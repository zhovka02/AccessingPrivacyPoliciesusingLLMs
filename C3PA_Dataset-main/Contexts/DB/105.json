This may include call recordings where we monitor and record such calls for staff training or quality assurance purposes. How We Receive Personal Data We may receive your Personal Data when: you provide it directly to us through our websites; our clients (including their employees, contractors, and other representatives) provide it to us; we receive it from other companies within our corporate group; our service providers provide it to us; we purchase lists of individuals who might be interested in becoming customers of our clients; you provide it on publicly accessible sources, such as on LinkedIn or your company website; or such information is captured as cookies, as outlined in the “Cookie” section below. Purposes of Processing We may process your Personal Data to: respond to your requests or questions; provide you with access to the Site and the content that is on it; process and complete transactions, including purchases of sales leads, and send you related information; provide technical and other support to you; send you promotional communications, such as providing you with information about services, features, surveys, newsletters, offers, and events; and providing other news or information about us, and the Lead Generation Services; enable Service Providers to perform certain responsibilities and provide certain services in connection with the Lead Generation Services and our business and operations; provide you with notices about your account; carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection; and to verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity. Basis of Processing We may process your Personal Data on the basis of: your consent; our legitimate interests in providing Lead Generation Services to our clients; the need to comply with the law; or any other ground, as required or permitted by law. Where we process your Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect processing performed on other lawful grounds. Data Retention When the purposes of processing are satisfied, we will delete the related Personal Data within six months, unless applicable laws require otherwise. Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties We may share Personal Data with our affiliates and clients, as well as with our service providers who process Personal Data on our behalf and who agree to use the Personal Data only to assist us in providing our services to our clients, or as required by law. Our service providers may provide: application hosting services; cloud storage services; business productivity services; communication services and software; email verification software; customer relationship management (CRM) software; and contact verification and data enrichment services. Some of these third parties may be located outside of the United States. However, before transferring your Personal Data to these third parties, we will either ask for your explicit consent or require the third party to maintain at least the same level of privacy and security for your Personal Data that we do. We remain liable for the protection of your Personal Data that we transfer or have transferred to third parties through our designated data transfer mechanism, except to the extent that we are not responsible for the event that leads to any unauthorized or improper processing. Some of these third parties may be located outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area. In some cases, the European Commission may not have determined that the countries’ data protection laws provide a level of protection equivalent to European Union law. We will only transfer your Personal Data to third parties in these countries when there are appropriate safeguards in place. These may include the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as approved by the European Commission. The SCCs are formally integrated into our agreements with third parties that we share EEA Personal Data with, and third parties on whose behalf we receive EEA Personal Data. Other Disclosure of Your Personal Data We may disclose your Personal Data to the extent required by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that we need to disclose it in order to comply with official investigations or legal proceedings (whether initiated by governmental/law enforcement officials, or private parties). We may also disclose your Personal Data if we sell or transfer all or some of our company’s business interests, assets, or both, or in connection with a corporate restructuring. Finally, we may disclose your Personal Data to our subsidiaries or affiliates, but only if necessary for business purposes, as described in the section above. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data for any legal business purpose. Such data does not include any Personal Data. The purposes may include analyzing usage trends or seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, and customers.
