This section of the Privacy Centre is intended solely for such consumers, i.e., “data subjects” and is intended to supplement the information already provided in the Privacy Policy found in the section above. You have a number of rights in relation to the personal data that we hold about you including: The right to access personal data we hold about you and to obtain information about how we process it The right to request that we rectify (correct) your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete The right to ask us to delete your personal data. We may continue to keep your personal data if we are entitled or required to The right to object to, and to request that we restrict, our processing of your personal data in some circumstances The right to receive certain personal data you’ve provided to us in an electronic format and/or request that we send it to a third party The right to withdraw your consent to us processing your personal data The right not to receive marketing communications from Blis If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at privacy@blis.com . If we are unable to action your request, we will explain the reasons for our refusal. California Privacy Rights The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides certain rights to residents of California. This section of the Privacy Centre applies if you are a resident of California and your “personal information” (referred to elsewhere in this document as “personal data” is collected or disclosed by us. This notice supplements the information already provided in the Privacy Policy found in the section above. As some of the data we process may be considered “personal information” under CCPA, we are required to make certain disclosures to California consumers. Please see this key to guide you through the Privacy Policy housed in our Privacy Centre. CCPA Blis Privacy Policy Section Categories of Personal Information collected in the previous 12 months What data do we collect and use Categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information What data do we collect and use The business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling Personal Information How your personal data will be used by us Categories of Personal Information shared or disclosed to third parties in the preceding 12 months and the categories of third parties with whom the information was disclosed or sold Who we share or disclose your personal data to California consumers have the following rights: To request that we disclose what information we collect, use, disclose or sell about you (twice in a 12-month period) To access the specific pieces of information we hold about you (twice in a 12-month period) To request the deletion of any of your personal information we collect or maintain, subject to certain exceptions (twice in a 12-month period) To non-discrimination – we will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights To opt out of the sale of your personal information Do Not Sell My Personal Information Under CCPA, California consumers have the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. CCPA broadly defines sale such that it may include, for example, allowing third parties to receive and use certain information, such as cookies, mobile advertising IDs, IP address and/or browsing behaviour, to deliver tailored or personalised advertising. When you opt out of the sale of your personal information, you will still receive ads, but we will not be able to use this data to personalise them to you and therefore they may be less useful. How to exercise your rights under CCPA California residents may exercise their California access or deletion rights by calling our toll-free number 1-866-I-OPT-OUT (1-866-467-8688) and enter code 1191#. or by emailing us at privacy@blis.com . For security purposes, we will verify your identity when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate and except where not permitted under applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CCPA. If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request. Authorised Agents You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights, and to verify that your agent has been authorised to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney. Your internet user choices We use your personal data to present you with ads which (we hope) are relevant and interesting to you. We think that this is a win-win for consumers, advertisers, and publishers because advertising revenue is one of the main reasons that the internet is mainly free. If you don’t want to receive personalised or interest-based ads from us then you can opt out, but please bear in mind that you may still receive ads from us. The only difference is that they won’t be personalised and therefore – we think – they will be less interesting and relevant to you. How to opt-out There are a number of different ways for you to opt-out of personalised or interest-based advertising: In-ad opt-out You may opt-out of Blis-delivered interest-based advertisements within a mobile website or mobile App by clicking on the enhanced notice/OBA icon included within that advertisement, and then selecting “opt-out” within the page to which you are redirected. 2. Using the TRUSTe app You may download the TRUSTe mobile app on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the use of mobile App-collected data for interest-based advertising by us and other companies that participate in that choice tool. Links to those applications are below: TRUSTe mobile appMobile applications opt-out iOS TRUSTe mobile app Android 3. In your mobile device settings To opt-out of the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising on your mobile device, you can modify the settings on your mobile device. For example: For Apple iOS Devices: On iOS version 14 and later only: You may withdraw your consent by disabling the “Allow Apps to Request to Track” setting in your iOS settings (precise directions may be different on different iOS versions). On iOS version 13 and earlier only: Go to Settings, Select Privacy, Select Advertising, and enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. To reset your Advertising Identifier on iOS, open “Settings”, tap “Privacy”, tap “Advertising”, and tap “Reset Advertising Identifier”. For Android Devices: Open the Settings app, then Google Settings app, select Ads then “Reset advertising ID” and choose “Opt-out of Ads Personalisation”. Note: The actual opt-out instructions for each device may differ slightly depending on operating system and updates. Also, after choosing to opt-out via any of the mechanisms described, if you use a different device or a different browser, or if you delete browser cookies, you may need to repeat the opt-out steps for that particular device or browser. In addition, if you block cookies on your browser or if third-party cookies are blocked by default, some of the opt-out tools above may not function. 4. Other methods You may also opt-out of the collection of data across unaffiliated sites over time for interest-based advertising and other purposes from companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page at www.aboutads.info/choices and from members of the Network Advertising Initiative via www.networkadvertising.org/choices . If you have any questions about your internet choices, please contact us at privacy@blis.com or for other methods please see “How to contact us”. Privacy FAQs What does Blis do? We are Blis, a digital advertising company. We provide services to companies including media agencies and their clients – global advertisers – who want to place advertisements or content, by using our technologies. Our services include, for instance, presenting you with personalised or tailored ads, verifying location data, measuring footfall attribution, facilitating advertising based on audience segments and inferred interests, cross-device retargeting and other attribution and location analytics. This short video explains more about how data is exchanged with partners for these advertising campaigns. To better understand how targeted advertising works, please visit: Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (“DAAC”) What is personal data? The definition of personal data (also known as personal information) changes according to the legislative structure that regulates it. In regards to European Legislation, more specifically the GDPR (‘General Data Protection Regulation), personal data is any data that can be used to ‘identify’ an individual. The definition could include anything from name, email address, passwords, usernames and can span right down to cookies or device identifiers. What personal data does Blis collect? We use cookies, mobile identifiers, tags, pixels, beacons, SDKs and other tracking technology to associate your usage data with you – or more accurately, with your device.  The personal data we hold about you is associated with a unique and pseudonymous identifier linked to your device.  We do not associate that identifier with your name, email, address, or phone number, because we don’t collect that type of directly identifying information about consumers. Why do you collect personal data? Blis uses the personal data to provide advertising services to its clients and customers. We use it to deliver more relevant advertising on behalf of our clients, to improve our products and services and to create new products. What is programmatic advertising? Put simply, programmatic advertising is the automated buying and selling of advertising. The methodologies are based on an efficient allocation model which allows advertisers to target their ads to the right users at the right time. This video explains the process in detail or you can read the example below to see how it works. Through using a computer or mobile phone device, a user decides to visit either an app or a web page. Within a few milliseconds, the page sends out a bid-request asking advertisers to fill an advertising space with an ad of their choice. The signal will contain information about the device so that the advertiser can fill the space with a more targeted advert. If the user has given their consent for the further processing of their data, then the bid-request would ultimately be competed for within an auction across a range of third-party companies (who would also have the right level of consent to process the user’s data). Who do you share my personal data with? Blis is a global business firm and any information that we collect or that you provide to us may be shared and processed by any Blis company or reseller. You can find out more about the Blis companies and locations here . We may also share your personal data with third parties so that they can help us to provide our advertising services. Some of these third parties are companies in relation to which you have previously given your consent, others are third parties that provide services to Blis. Their services include ad serving, brand safety, viewability, ad fraud, insights, measurement, data, location-based attribution, targeting, optimisation, infrastructure and storage. For a list of all third parties, together with explanatory information about the different types of third party, please see our ‘Blis Third Parties and Partners’ listed below. We may also (but we expect this to be very infrequent) share personal data with our professional advisers, such as lawyers and accountants, as well as government, police forces, and/or regulatory authorities (where legally appropriate to do so). We may also share your personal data as part of actual or potential business sale of Blis or its assets, to prevent suspected fraud, to respond to claims asserted against us, or to comply with legal processes such as court order. How do you keep my personal data safe and secure? We use a range of measures to keep your personal data safe and secure. This includes protection against unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data we collect and store. Data collected and used by our services is held securely by Google Cloud. Data protection is a priority for Google and they are certified against recognised international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27018 and ISO/IEC 27017. How do I exercise my rights? Please visit our section on data protection rights and your internet user choices. What are cookies and why do you use them?
