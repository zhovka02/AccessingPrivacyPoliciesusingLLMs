Your EEA Rights With Respect to Personal Data Some data protection laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), corresponding legislation in the United Kingdom, and some U.S. state laws, provide you with certain rights in connection with Personal Data you have shared with us.

You may find more information about entities involved in online advertising and additional choices you may make, including opt-out of having your information used for internet-based advertising, through the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the NAI Service , and the Digital Advertising Alliance (the “DAA”) at the DAA consumer choice service . IDology is a participant in the online industry’s self-regulatory program administered by the DAA and has agreed to adhere to the DAA’s principles applicable to interest-based ads. The tools provided at the DAA opt-out page and the NAI opt-out page are provided by third parties, not IDology. IDology does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. Third-Party Links The Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than IDology. We do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites. Our inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators. Further, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party’s website. IDology strongly recommends that each User review the third party’s terms and policies. International Transfer We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government standards regarding the protection of Personal Data. Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be used globally in connection with employment, business processes within IDology, or communicating with our IDology Partners. Therefore, Personal Data may be transferred to such entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws that are applicable in each country. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country. If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders to ensure that your Personal Data is protected. How We Protect Personal Data IDology maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User’s Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to IDology employees, contractors, business partners and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data. If IDology collects account information for payment or credit, IDology will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered. Minors The Site is not intended for use by minors. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors of this Site who are minors.  If a minor has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that minor may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a minor, please contact us at compliance@gbgplc.com . If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a minor, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please note that we do not control the information that we receive for processing under our Services from our customers or Partners, which we know may contain information from consumers under the age of 16. Therefore, we have actual knowledge that we may sell the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age (but not of consumers under the age of 13). Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals IDology does not track its users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies. California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed Personal Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Under the California “Shine the Light” law, California residents may opt-out of our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of the sharing of your Personal Data with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by submitting a request via our webform . California users may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting us via our webform or by writing to us at the address listed in the “How to Contact Us” section. Changes to this Privacy Policy Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or programs, email notification or privacy policy changes).
