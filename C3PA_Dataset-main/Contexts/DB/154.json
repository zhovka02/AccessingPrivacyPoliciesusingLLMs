Through our Services we establish user connections between devices, browsers, apps and events, and provide data, insights and reporting to clients for commercial and advertising purposes. In this privacy policy, “users” (also referred to as “you” or “your”) means end users or visitors of browsers, applications, devices or other forms of media; “partners” means suppliers and data sources who provide us with data related to users; and “clients” means our customers. In order to provide our Services, we collect and store select information from devices, applications and browsers directly through the tracking technologies described below. We may also receive additional information about the device, browser, application, a user or a user’s use of a device, website, application or browser from partners or clients that have an existing relationship with the user, or from other third parties ‍ DATA ELEMENTS WE COLLECT AND SHARE FOR SERVICE Time stamp User agent string that specifies device and browser information Operating system Device type (in case of mobile devices) IP address Unique device identifier stored in a browser cookie Mobile ad identifiers (in case of mobile devices) Third-party cookie identifiers Web page or application where an ad may be placed Web page or application that the individual is using when a MediaWallah pixel fires Anonymous data that can be extrapolated from an IP address.

Pixels. A pixel is a piece of code that may be used on a website you visit or email messages that you view or receive,which allows our clients, partners and us to record the types of information specified above (see the section entitled “Data Elements We Collect). Pixels are also known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags.” Application software development kits(SDKs). An SDK is a library of code that is embedded directly in partner applications.

We use the data we collect to provide data, insights and reports to our clients, to enable our clients to synchronize or target advertising or content, and to enable our clients to understand the performance of advertising or content across relevant devices.
