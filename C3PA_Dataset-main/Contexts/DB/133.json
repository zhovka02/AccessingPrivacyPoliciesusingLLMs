This data collection takes\n\t\t\t\t\tplace both on the AutoWeb Sites and on Third-Party’s websites and mobile applications. This process\n\t\t\t\t\tallows AutoWeb and Third Parties to deliver Interest-Based Advertising, and helps track the\n\t\t\t\t\teffectiveness of such efforts. Advertising Networks also may use this information for determining or\n\t\t\t\t\tpredicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and\n\t\t\t\t\tmeasuring the effectiveness of their advertising. To provide Consumers with content and services that we believe are relevant to a particular location\n\t\t\t\t\tand to customize marketing to the Consumer. When a Consumer downloads or uses the AutoWeb Sites, we\n\t\t\t\t\tmay collect Geolocation Data. We may use Geolocation Data and provide it to Third Parties to provide\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Consumer with content and services that are relevant to a particular location, such as\n\t\t\t\t\tadvertising, search results, vehicle dealers in the area, and directions and to customize marketing\n\t\t\t\t\tto the Consumer for what is available in the Consumer’s area or close proximity. This Geolocation\n\t\t\t\t\tData may reveal a Consumer’s actual location, such as GPS data, or it may not, such as when the\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer submits a partial address to look at a map of the area. Service improvement We use Personal Information to engage improvement of our Services: To provide you with a good experience when you use our services and/or to show you more personalized\n\t\t\t\t\tadvertising, including advertising on other websites, we use Data Technologies to distinguish you\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom other users of our websites and apps (including when you browse third party websites). One or\n\t\t\t\t\tmore Data Technologies may be used on the AutoWeb Sites and other websites and mobile applications\n\t\t\t\t\t(that may not be the AutoWeb Sites) by AutoWeb or Third Parties. Data Technologies may be used to\n\t\t\t\t\tcollect information about web pages you visited and visit and to transmit information to you or\n\t\t\t\t\tabout you and connect information about you from different sources, websites, devices, and mobile\n\t\t\t\t\tapplications.  AutoWeb places or \"sets\" AutoWeb cookies on a Consumer’s computer or device when the\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer visits AutoWeb Sites. We may also set cookies on a Consumer’s computer or device on behalf\n\t\t\t\t\tof Third Parties authorized by AutoWeb or may enable certain Third Parties to set their own cookies\n\t\t\t\t\ton the Consumer’s computer or device.

These cookies\n\t\t\t\t\ttrack visits, page views and click stream behavior. Third Party tracking services report this data\n\t\t\t\t\tto AutoWeb in aggregated form. AutoWeb shares such anonymous, aggregated information obtained from\n\t\t\t\t\tthese cookies with our advertisers and other Third Parties. To help diagnose problems with our servers, administer the AutoWeb Sites and track site usage\n\t\t\t\t\tstatistics, anytime you visit AutoWeb Sites, we collect the Internet Protocol\n\t\t\t\t\t(“ IP ”) address. A\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer’s IP address may vary each time the Consumer visits, or it may be the same, depending on\n\t\t\t\t\thow the Consumer accesses the Internet. We also collect information on whether the Consumer reached\n\t\t\t\t\tan AutoWeb Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on a Third Party site, which helps us to\n\t\t\t\t\tmaximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. We also collect\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation on the Consumer’s ISP (internet service provider) or mobile carrier and the type of\n\t\t\t\t\thandheld or mobile device the Consumer used. All of this information is collected and used only in\n\t\t\t\t\tthe aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall\n\t\t\t\t\treports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors. To enhance a Consumer’s experience on AutoWeb Sites, AutoWeb uses Google Analytics to collect\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation through Data Technologies. This data is collected on an anonymized basis and is\n\t\t\t\t\taggregated but may include or be associated with other non-Personal Information or with\n\t\t\t\t\tVoluntarily-Provided Personal Information.

(\" Google \") that helps website owners understand how visitors engage\n\t\t\t\t\twith their website.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with AutoWeb Sites so we can improve\n\t\t\t\t\tthe AutoWeb Sites. Google uses first party cookies and IP addresses, and it reports website trends\n\t\t\t\t\twithout identifying individual visitors.

We may also use VWO to capture our visitors' website experiences, without seeing the\n\t\t\t\t\ttext of anything the visitors type in. We use it to be able to understand how Consumers use the\n\t\t\t\t\tAutoWeb Sites to improve the user experience. Information collected by VWO is governed by its own\n\t\t\t\t\tprivacy policy, which can be found here.

As we continue to\n\t\t\t\tdevelop our business, we might sell or buy websites, subsidiaries or business units. In such\n\t\t\t\ttransactions, Personal Information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the\n\t\t\t\tevent that AutoWeb or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Personal Information will of course\n\t\t\t\tbe one of the transferred assets. In addition, Personal Information will be disclosed as part of any\n\t\t\t\tcreation of a separate business to provide an AutoWeb Site, or to provide other services or fulfill\n\t\t\t\tproducts; debt financing, sale or pledge of company assets, or insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.\n\t\t\t\tWe will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the acquirer of our users' Personal Information respects\n\t\t\t\tthe provisions of this Policy, although this may not be possible in certain legal settings (such as\n\t\t\t\tbankruptcy). VI.         Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information You may limit and control the Personal Information collected by us in a number of ways.  Note that\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia residents may have additional limitation and control rights that are described in the section\n\t\t\t\tof this Privacy Policy entitled “ Notice to California Residents Regarding Your California\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy\n\t\t\t\t\tRights. ” Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information You are not required to provide any Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information to visit or use the\n\t\t\t\tAutoWeb Sites. You may elect to not provide Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information for any purpose.\n\t\t\t\tHowever, in doing so, you may not be able to use all features provided by the AutoWeb Sites or all\n\t\t\t\tservices provided by AutoWeb. For example, if you do not provide the Voluntarily-Provided Information\n\t\t\t\trequired to submit a Consumer Request, you will not be able to submit Consumer Requests, and AutoWeb and\n\t\t\t\tvehicle sellers, manufacturers and other Third Party service and product providers will not be able to\n\t\t\t\tcontact you to provide you the products, services or information in which you may be interested. You may\n\t\t\t\talso choose not to participate in surveys. Opting Out of Email Marketing We provide our users with the ability to choose whether to receive email communications from us and to\n\t\t\t\tpermit their Personal Information to be disclosed to Third Parties for marketing or related purposes. If\n\t\t\t\ta Consumer does not wish to receive promotional and marketing communications from us, the Consumer may\n\t\t\t\tdo so (i) if the Consumer received a promotional or marketing email from us, by following the link for\n\t\t\t\tthat purpose located at the bottom of the email, or (ii) by sending a request to us by contacting our\n\t\t\t\tConsumer Care Department as provided under the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Contact Us”\n\t\t\t\tbelow. However, withdrawing a Consumer’s consent will not affect the use of the Consumer’s Personal\n\t\t\t\tInformation by Third Parties that previously received the Consumer’s Personal Information to continue to\n\t\t\t\tsend communications to the Consumer and otherwise use the Consumer’s Personal Information. In addition, we provide you the opportunity to indicate your preferences as to what types of offerings\n\t\t\t\tof products or services you wish to receive from Third Parties or, subject to the exceptions below, to\n\t\t\t\topt-out of disclosures to those Third Parties altogether. You may update your preferences at any time by\n\t\t\t\tcontacting us at consumercare@autoweb.com . Those Third\n\t\t\t\tParties who receive your Personal Information\n\t\t\t\tprior to your opt-out will remain able to send you communications, subject to their privacy policies and\n\t\t\t\tpractices. To opt-out from receiving third party emails, you must contact those third parties directly. Even if a Consumer decides not to receive offers or other product or service information, AutoWeb and\n\t\t\t\tthe dealers, manufacturers, other product and services providers, fulfillment third-parties and other\n\t\t\t\treferral services with which AutoWeb has relationships, may use a phone number, mailing address or email\n\t\t\t\taddress that the Consumer has provided to contact the Consumer regarding a Consumer Request that the\n\t\t\t\tConsumer submitted. Additionally, phone numbers and email addresses may be used to conduct customer\n\t\t\t\tsurveys regarding individual experiences with AutoWeb, dealers, or other product and services providers.\n\t\t\t\tPhone numbers and email addresses are made available only to AutoWeb, its affiliates and dealers,\n\t\t\t\tmanufacturers, other referral services, fulfillment third parties and other referral services who\n\t\t\t\treceive a Consumer Request. If a Consumer requests to opt-out of receiving emails from us and then subsequently submits a Consumer\n\t\t\t\tRequest (either directly or submitted through a Third-Party and are referred to us), this action will\n\t\t\t\treinstate the relationship with us and we will use the Consumer’s Personal Information as set forth\n\t\t\t\therein, unless the Consumer subsequently requests to opt-out again. Each time a Consumer submits a\n\t\t\t\tConsumer Request, this process will restart. Automatically-Collected Personal Information Opting Out of Data Technologies.

We do not knowingly collect, sell, or share Personal\n\t\t\t\tInformation of Minors under age 16 and do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share Personal\n\t\t\t\tInformation of Minors under age 16. If you are under 16 years old, you should not provide Personal\n\t\t\t\tInformation to any AutoWeb Website.

VIII.         When Third Party Privacy Policies, Terms of Use and\n\t\t\t\t\tConsents To Marketing Calls and Texting Govern the Collection, Use, Sale or Sharing of Personal\n\t\t\t\t\tInformation A Consumer’s Personal Information is collected by a Third Party: When the Consumer initially provides the Third Party the Consumer’s Personal Information on a Third\n\t\t\t\t\tParty site and not on an AutoWeb Site. When a Consumer clicks on a link to a Third Party site from an AutoWeb Site, including clicking on a\n\t\t\t\t\tThird Party advertisement placed on an AutoWeb Site, the Consumer will leave the AutoWeb Site the\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer was visiting and be redirected to the Third Party site. When we sell, share, disclose or otherwise transfer the Consumer’s Personal Information to the Third\n\t\t\t\t\tParty, for example, when we sell a Consumer Request to a vehicle dealer to contact the Consumer\n\t\t\t\t\tregarding the information, product or services the Consumer requested. When AutoWeb authorizes a Third Party to place the Third Party’s cookie or other Data Technology on\n\t\t\t\t\tan AutoWeb site. When AutoWeb authorizes a Third Party to offer their products and services on AutoWeb Sites through\n\t\t\t\t\tuse of a \"framed\" format, where the AutoWeb border will surround the pages served by the Third\n\t\t\t\t\tParty, or by directly linking the user to the Third Party’s sites. In either case, the Third Party\n\t\t\t\t\tis prominently identified. When a Consumer’s Personal Information is collected by a Third Party, the Third Party’s collection, use,\n\t\t\t\tsale, sharing, disclosure or other transfer the Consumer’s Personal Information is governed by the Third\n\t\t\t\tParty’s privacy policy and terms of use. In addition, the Third Party is responsible for obtaining the\n\t\t\t\tConsumer’s consent under the TCPA if the Personal Information collected includes your telephone number\n\t\t\t\t(landline or mobile). Because we do not control the activities of Third Parties, we do not accept or\n\t\t\t\tassume responsibility for any collection, use, storage, sale, sharing, disclosure or other transfer of\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Information by such Third Parties or with respect to obtaining your consumer consent, and we\n\t\t\t\tcannot represent or guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices or procedures as\n\t\t\t\tAutoWeb. We encourage Consumer’s to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any Third Parties to\n\t\t\t\twhich a Consumer provides Personal Information or from which a Consumer requests information, products\n\t\t\t\tor services. IX.         Security Procedures and Practices AutoWeb has implemented and maintains reasonable administrative,\n\t\t\t\ttechnical, personnel, and physical\n\t\t\t\tsecurity procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the Personal Information and designed to\n\t\t\t\tprotect the Personal Information stored in our systems against unauthorized or illegal access,\n\t\t\t\tdestruction, use, modification, or disclosure.

Any\n\t\t\t\tchanges to our Privacy Policy will be posted at this URL, so be sure to check back often and consult the\n\t\t\t\tlast updated version.

A verifiable consumer request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify, using commercially reasonable methods, that\n\t\t\t\t\tyou are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and\n\t\t\t\t\trespond to it. For Requests to Delete, we may use a two-step process for online Requests to Delete where the\n\t\t\t\t\tConsumer must first submit the request and then separately confirm that the Consumer wants to delete\n\t\t\t\t\tthe Consumer’s Personal Information. The California Privacy Act requires that we verify the identity of the requesting Consumer to a\n\t\t\t\treasonable degree of certainty or reasonably high degree of certainty depending on the type of request\n\t\t\t\tand the Personal Information about the requesting Consumer maintained by us, as well as the sensitivity\n\t\t\t\tof the Personal Information and the risk of harm to the Consumer posed by unauthorized deletion, access\n\t\t\t\tor correction. We cannot comply with your Request to Know, Request to Delete or Request to Correct if we\n\t\t\t\tcannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information\n\t\t\t\trelates to you.

We are not obligated to provide a Consumer the information requested in response to a Request to Know\n\t\t\t\tmore than twice within a 12-month period. With respect to Requests to Correct, if we deny a Request to Correct because we have determined that the\n\t\t\t\tcontested Personal Information is more likely than not accurate based on the totality of the\n\t\t\t\tcircumstances, we may elect to delete the contested Personal Information if the deletion does not\n\t\t\t\tnegatively impact the Consumer or the Consumer consents to the deletion.

Requests to Opt-In To Sale/Sharing A Consumer who has exercised the Consumer’s right to opt-out from the sale and/or share of the\n\t\t\t\tConsumer’s Personal Information, may change the Consumer’s mind and opt back in to personal information\n\t\t\t\tsales or sharing at any time by submitting a request to our Consumer Care Department by email\n\t\t\t\tat consumercare@autoweb.com or by calling\n\t\t\t\tvia our toll-free number at (800) 267-2015. A two-step\n\t\t\t\tprocess will be used whereby the Consumer must first clearly submit the request to opt-in, and then\n\t\t\t\tsecond, separately confirm the Consumer’s choice to opt-in.

To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more. This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you wish to contact the website’s owner please use the website's form Screen-reader and keyboard navigation Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements: Screen-reader optimization: we run a process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images. It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Disability profiles supported on our website Epilepsy Safe Profile: this profile enables people with epilepsy to safely use the website by eliminating the risk of seizures resulting from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.

ADHD Friendly Profile : this profile significantly reduces distractions and noise to help people with ADHD, and Neurodevelopmental disorders browse, read, and focus on the essential elements more easily. Blind Users Profile (Screen-readers): this profile adjusts the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is installed on the blind user’s computer, and this site is compatible with it. Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments Font adjustments – users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more. Color adjustments – users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds with over seven different coloring options. Animations – epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions. Content highlighting – users can choose to emphasize essential elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only. Audio muting – users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly. Cognitive disorders – we utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others. Additional functions – we allow users to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions. Assistive technology and browser compatibility We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users. Notes, comments, and feedback Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements.

If you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the AutoWeb Sites or Services, and we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction. We may also ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us online or offline by telephone or texting, including in connection with customer surveys. Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information is also obtained from Third Parties that sell Consumer Requests to AutoWeb where the Voluntarily-Provided Personal Information is collected by the Third Party from the Consumer on the Third Party’s website and sold to AutoWeb to fulfill the Consumer’s Consumer Request by referral to an AutoWeb vehicle seller customer.\\nPersonal Information Automatically Collected From Consumers.\\nThird-Party Data Sources. We may collect Personal Information from third-party data sources such as advertising networks, marketing agencies, internet service providers, data brokers, operating systems and platforms, analytics firms, government agencies, and social networks.\\nVehicle Dealerships. We may collect Personal Information from vehicle dealerships with whom you interact. For example, if you purchase or lease a vehicle at a dealership, the dealership may share with us Personal Information relating the vehicle you purchased from the dealer or another Third Party.\\nMobile-specific information that we may collect. AutoWeb collects information from a Consumer’s mobile devices such as hardware IDs and device type, the request type, your carrier, the Consumer’s carrier user ID, and the content of the Consumer’s request, which does not by itself identify the Consumer, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that the Consumer may consider personal. \\nTrackable Telephone Numbers. We publish uniquely-generated, trackable toll-free phone numbers for many of the dealers that list vehicles for sale on the AutoWeb Sites or in advertisements posted on AutoWeb Sites. If a Consumer dials one of these telephone numbers, AutoWeb or a service provider operating on AutoWeb's behalf may record the date, time and length of the Consumer’s call and the phone number from which the call originated.\\nCombined or Appended Personal Information and Personal Information from Third Parties. We may obtain from Third Parties Personal Information that they have collected and combine that information with Personal Information that that we have collected. The combined information may include information about the Consumer’s use of the AutoWeb Sites; use of Third Party websites, devices and mobile applications; interactions or transactions with vehicle dealers; interests and preferences; and other information about the Consumer or the Consumer’s household.\\nSales Matching. When we refer a Consumer to a vehicle seller, we may obtain sales matching data from the vehicle seller or other Third Parties that contains Personal Information that we did not originally provide to the vehicle dealer or other Third Parties. Sales matching data may include the make, model and trim of the vehicle purchased; the purchase price; and the purchase date.",
