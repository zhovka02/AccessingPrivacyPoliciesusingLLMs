Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to: Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information; Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you; Delete certain personal information we have about you; and Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.

If you would like further information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please use the contact information below. California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  Under the CCPA, “sale” is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers or who are otherwise not restricted from using data only on our behalf or pursuant to an applicable CCPA exception.  On behalf of our clients, in some circumstances we may collect and analyze information about their donor base and return enhanced information to them about their donors.  This could be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.  If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information .  Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization. If a company shares “personal information” (as defined in California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code § 1798.83) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes (e.g., to send offers and information that may be of interest to you), California law requires either providing a mechanism by which consumers can obtain more information about such sharing over the prior calendar year, or providing a mechanism by which consumers can opt out of such sharing.  As discussed above, we provide an opt out for this sharing.  If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of sharing pursuant to this law, please use the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link above.
