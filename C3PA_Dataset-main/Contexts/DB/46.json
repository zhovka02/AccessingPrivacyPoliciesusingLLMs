The following policy (\"Privacy Policy\") describes the type of information we collect about persons and entities who engage in our company's services (\"Business Clients\"), how we secure that information, how we use that information, and the choices you have regarding the collection and use of your private information. 1. Information We Collect. 1.1 User Direct Information. Each time you provide or transmit information to our Company, we obtain and collect personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, email address, mailing address, social security number, credit card information, bank account information and telephone or mobile phone number(s) (collectively \"personally identifiable information\" or \"PII\"). 1.2 Survey Information. Company may collect PII when you voluntarily complete a Company survey, order form, or a registration page, either online (by using the Internet) or offline (by providing this information through the mail, in person or using a telephone). 1.3 Third Party Information. Company may collect PII from you when you provide information to a third party, and Company subsequently acquires or uses the information provided by that third party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone number(s) (including mobile phone number(s) and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as you may have provided to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company seeks assurances from the third party that you agreed to provide such information and to such information subsequently being acquired by Company. If you did not give your express permission, or you would like to remove your permission, you may suppress all your information by sending to us at unsubscribe@therooftop.io , or you may change your PII using your log in password. 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology. Company currently uses cookie and Web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information held in its database. Additionally, Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future. Company does not acknowledge do not track cookies. Cookies. \"Cookies\" are a feature in your browser software. If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of websites owned and operated by Company (each a \"website\"). Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you, and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit a website again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to keep track of the number of return visits to our website, accumulate and report aggregate statistical information on website usage, deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history, and save your password for ease of access to our website. You can disable cookies, although the website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all the features and functionality of our Company's websites, you need to accept cookies. Web Beacons. A Web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a Web page but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information in that database. They are also known as \"clear gifs,\" \"one-pixel gifs,\" \"Web bugs,\" \"Internet tags,\" or \"pixel tags.\" This allows Company to track certain websites that you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes in order to determine which products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using Web beacons on Web pages, Company also uses Web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company's database. IP Addresses. Company automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on our websites. We may use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior, to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") is a unique Internet \"address\" which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\"). For Local Area Network (\"LAN\"), Dedicated Server Line (\"DSL\"), or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers collecting information about a user's traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. Computer Profiles. Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with PII, we can use such visitor data to identify you. Data Analysis. Data analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Business Client of Company. 2. How Information is Used and Shared. 2.1 Disclosure of Information to Service Providers and Third-Party Vendors. Although much of our disclosures are governed by our contracts with our Business Clients, Company may disclose your PII to third party service providers and vendors in order to carry out any transaction that you have requested from us, or as necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. This includes email service providers, providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data hygiene providers, data enhancement providers, suppression services and validation services. We contractually prohibit the sale or transfer of PII by such service providers and vendors. We may share PII with affiliated companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control, of Company. 2.2 Disclosure of Web Technology Related PII. Company uses and discloses information collected by cookies and Web technology to third party vendors to enhance your online experience by allowing Company to save your preferences for your next visit. Cookies may also measure the general activity on the website, which allows Company to determine which areas and features are most popular in order to make improvements to the website. Web beacons, also known as \"clear gifs,\" \"one-pixel gifs,\" \"Web bugs,\" \"Internet tags,\" or \"pixel tags,\" are used by Company and third parties to monitor the activity on our website or to make cookies more effective. We use log files to store the data that is collected through Web beacons. 2.3 Complying with Legal Process. Company will use or disclose your PII in response to subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to otherwise establish or exercise Company's legal rights, or defend against legal claims, or in the event of a breach in an agreement with Company. Company will use and disclose your PII if Company believes that a user of this website, or a Business Client, will harm the property or rights of Company, its owners, or Company's other customers. Finally, Company will use or disclose PII if it believes that it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action, regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of Company's acceptable use policy. 2.4 Merger or Sale of Company. If Company sells, merges or otherwise reorganizes its business, Company reserves the right to transfer and disclose PII to the purchaser or investors, but will require such person or entity to govern the collection, storage and use of PII, by the same Privacy Policy that existed prior to any such business change, unless and until you consent to a new Privacy Policy. 3. Choices Regarding PII Use and Sharing. As the only information we collect through our Corporate website is information we use to connect with Business Clients and prospective clients, we do not provide an opt-out for information collected. If you would like to correct or be removed from our client database, please contact us at privacyofficer@therooftop.io . If you wish to review the PII related to you which has been collected by Company on our websites, please provide the request in writing to privacyofficer@therooftop.io . Company reserves the right to confirm the identity and association of the person requesting such information prior to any disclosure. 4. Security We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. We use redundant and robust servers to host internal data, which are also protected by high performance firewalls housed in one of the premium collocation services in California. Our Web frontend and application systems are user and password protected to prevent access from unauthorized users. Access restriction rules and policies by IP address and domain are also implemented on our high-performance firewalls. Thus, when you submit information via the website, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store PII are kept in a secure physical environment. Company has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. In addition, Company currently uses Secure Socket Layer software (\"SSL\") to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information including credit card numbers, and names and addresses, as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although Company takes reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure; therefore, Company cannot and does not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our websites is at your own risk. 5. Do Not Call Waiver By registering via our websites, or otherwise, for our services, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR 310, et seq.), as amended from time to time, and other telemarketing laws such as the FCC rules. Notwithstanding that your telephone number(s) may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we reserve the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule. 6. No Information Collected from Children Company will never knowingly collect any PII about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected PII about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. 7. Changes to Privacy Policy We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy Policy. We will post those changes through a prominent notice on the website, so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.
