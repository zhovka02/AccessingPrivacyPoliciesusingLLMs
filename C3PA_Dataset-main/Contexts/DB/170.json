Data Retention and Security Our data retention policies are customized to the type of data, and the purpose for which we use it. In general, for data we collect directly from you, such as when you make an account or purchase our services, we delete, and/or anonymize and aggregate that data three years after you last login to your account, or when you choose to delete your account. An exception to this is when we maintain data for the purpose of security, the prevention of fraud, customer service, or a legal obligation.  In the event we maintain data for one of these excepted uses, it is maintained solely for that purpose. For data collected from licensing or publicly available sources, such as the data you see when you make a search on Social Catfish, it is maintained for one of two possible retention periods.  If a search is made without registering an account, the data is not retained after the search is closed.  If you register an account, your account will keep a copy of the data you searched for until you delete your account, three years have passed since your last login, or the data becomes subject to a deletion request. We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.he safety and security of your information also depends on you.

We ask you not to share your password with anyone. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for user personal information we process and maintain, no security measures can guarantee absolute safety and prevent all potential security breaches. 8. Fraudulent Requests. Social Catfish takes consumer requests seriously, and endeavors to protect your privacy and comply with your requests.  However, if Social Catfish has a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a consumer request is fraudulent, Social Catfish may deny such a request.  This basis for denial applies to all consumer requests and may be subject to the limitations and requirements of applicable, state privacy laws with which Social Catfish will always comply. Examples of fraudulent requests include, but are not limited to: Impersonating another person. If you make a request, you must do so in your own name, or as an authorized agent of another person.  If you are an authorized agent of another person, you must disclose that fact and provide proof of the consumer’s authorization. Impersonating another person not only violates our Terms of Use, it also is fraud. Obscuring your identity as a consumer making a request. Knowing who is making a request about their information is foundational to the process of completing those requests.  It also is against our Terms of Use for users to disguise the identity or origin of any message sent to Social Catfish.  Examples of this include forging headers, using a virtual private network (VPN) to obscure your IP address, or otherwise obscuring or anonymizing your email or IP address.  Social Catfish is happy to comply with your request but it essential that we know you are a real person and that you are who you claim to be. Using automated means to send multiple unverified requests or requests without proof of authorization. Social Catfish is happy to work with third party authorized agents to process bulk consumer requests and does so successfully with a number of agents.  Using automated means to submit multiple or bulk unverified requests, or requests without any proof of authorization, to Social Catfish is against our Terms of Use , puts a disproportionate load on our systems, and interferes with our processing of legitimate consumer requests. 9. General Opt-Out Requests If you wish to remove your information from the site, please submit an opt out request through our Opt-Out form: https://socialcatfish.com/opt-out/. You will need to verify your email address and submit all URLs with your information. If Social Catfish suspects a fraudulent request, or the request is made by a third-party without any proof of written authorization from the individual the third-party seeks to opt out, Social Catfish may deny the opt-out request. Please note that only pages that contain your information will be removed. You will need to go into each individual URL and submit the URL for removal. Also, note that removing a URL from our site does not remove your information through public record or any other sites. If you wish to make a CCPA or Nevada Opt-Out request, please see the details related to those requests in the relevant sections below. 10. Opt-Out Signals This Website can receive and respect opt-out signals compliant with the Global Privacy Control standard.  You can learn more about Global Privacy Control, and the compatible browsers and applications here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/ . Please note that as of now, a browser’s opt-out signal can only be correlated with any Personal Information Collected through the Website.  Social Catfish search results are obtained in a manner unrelated to your browser or device, and we cannot automatically link your browser with the data from those databases.  Even if you register an account with Social Catfish, our search results contain records pertaining to multiple people with the same name, which necessitates manual verification and alteration.  If you would like more control over your privacy, you can exercise your opt-out rights per the rest of this policy. 11. Children’s Privacy This Website is only available to users 18 and over. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide personally identifiable information of any kind whatsoever. 12.
