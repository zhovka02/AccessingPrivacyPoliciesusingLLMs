Advertising and analytics choices T-Mobile data use for the Ad Program Under T-Mobile 's Ad Program, T-Mobile will use certain data (1) for Analytics and Reporting (2) to deliver Relevant Ads, and (3) to deliver Personalized Ads and Offers. Analytics and reporting For Analytics and Reporting, our program is designed to use information from your device (i.e., app usage data like app name, installation status, how often an app was opened and zip code) and data from your use of T-Mobile products and services, such as self-declared data like age range (e.g., 25-34) and gender, to prepare aggregated business and marketing reports that we use and share with other companies. These reports do not identify you personally. One example might be a report showing how often a game was downloaded in the past year across large numbers of users. We will use this data unless you tell us not to by opting out. Relevant ads For Relevant Ads, T-Mobile will use and analyze app usage data from your Android device like app name, app installation status, and how often an app was opened, self-declared data from your use of T-Mobile products and services such as age range (e.g., 25-34) and gender, and high-level app usage data from your T-Mobile broadband to create models and inferences (e.g., sports lover, cooking enthusiast). To illustrate what high-level app usage data from your broadband is used, we process the name of an app you opened, like a recipe app, and how long you spent in that app, but we do not see any additional information, like, for example, that you looked at Italian and Thai recipes. We do not use app usage data to select advertisements, we only use your mobile advertising ID (MAID) and the models and inferences created from the app usage data. We and our advertising partners will use your MAID from your device and data from third party partners to deliver Relevant Ads to you. We will use this data unless you tell us not to by opting out. When we share MAIDs and inferences with third parties, it is not tied to your name or information that directly identifies you. Personalized Ads and Offers In addition to the data used for relevant ads, with your consent, we and our service providers will use precise location and other self-declared data you provide to us such as age range (e.g., 35-54), gender, interests, and survey responses from your device and top-level domain information about your web browsing activity from your broadband data to provide you with more personalized ads and offers. To illustrate, we process the top-level name/URL of the website you visited, such as a major retail website, but we do not look at what web pages within that site you visited (e.g., clothes or toasters). We won’t use this data unless you opt-in and we’ll stop using it if you opt-out. We don’t use or share Customer Proprietary Network Information (“ CPNI ”) for advertising unless you give us your express permission or as allowed by law to advertise certain T-Mobile products or services. We also do not use information from T-Mobile prepaid accounts or Assurance Wireless accounts for advertising. We also do not use information for advertising from accounts where a corporation or government agency is responsible for paying the bill. And if we know information belongs to a child, we don’t use it for advertising. For more information about data we use and share for the Ad Program, visit our Privacy Dashboard .

Your use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature.
