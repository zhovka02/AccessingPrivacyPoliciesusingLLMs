Introduction and General Terms This Privacy Policy covers the processing of personal data by Cognism Limited ( “Cognism” , “we” , “us” or “our” in this policy) when providing its services to its clients. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy please contact us at: Telephone: +44 20 3858 0822 Email: privacy@cognism.com Cognism is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the basis on which personal data we collect from you or from public sources will be processed by us. Where we decide the purpose or means for which this personal data is processed, we are the “data controller.” We will comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. You have the right to object to us processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. Please see paragraph 7 below for more details on how to do this. This Privacy Policy explains the following: What personal data we may collect about you; Why our processing is lawful; Who we may share your information with; How we will use that information; Who we may disclose that information to; and Your rights regarding the information. 2. What information will COGNISM collect about me? We collect and process the following data, which may include your personal data. Cognism’s Website: If you contact us about our services or request a demo on our website, the forms you complete or the emails you send may include information about you, such as your full name, your email address, the organisation on behalf of whom you are contacting us and your enquiry. Cognism’s Online Client Platform: In order to provide a Cognism Client with access to our platform and enable them to access our services, we collect the full name, email address and password of each individual authorised by such client to access the platform. Analytics on the Website and the Platform: Our website and online client platform uses cookies and other mechanisms to collect and log analytical information, to help analyse use, to compile statistical reports on use of our website and to improve our website and marketing. To find out more about the use of cookies and adjust your cookie preferences, please see our cookie policy here. The following data may be collected: number of visitors to our website; pages visited while at the website and time spent per page; page interaction information, such as scrolling, clicks and browsing methods; websites where visitors have come from and where they go afterwards; page response times and any download errors; and other technical information relating to end user device, such as IP address or browser plug-in. Cognism Database: Cognism gathers current and historic business contact data. The data collected about individuals on the Cognism Database comprises: Name; Employer Company & Company Details; Office Location (Country & City); Business Telephone Number; Business Email Address; Job Title. We also hold data in respect of your employer company such as its name, alias, size, industry, website and industry. In some case we estimate individuals’ net worth based on publically available data (for example, the individual’s employment history or if such individual previously sold shares in a company). Where you have moved jobs, we may hold your previous employers and previous titles. In order to provide certain aspects of its services, Cognism requires a business email address to be recorded against profiles in its database. Where Cognism does not have the business email address of a profile, it may generate a business email address based on the email address structure understood to be implemented by the employer company. We also hold hashed personal email addresses. Hashing is a method of encryption, whereby the email address itself is confuscated, and replaced with a unique reference instead, called a hash. A hash is one of the means used to locate the same individual on social networking. We do not reverse the hash or use the personal email address to contact you. The majority of the personal data we collect about you comes from publicly available sources such as from business and employment-oriented social networks, recruitment websites and company websites. Information is also gathered from correspondence with you (by email or phone), from our clients, recruiters and other premium data providers. Cognism does not seek to collect any non-business-related data such as date of birth, home address, personal email or telephone number and Cognism does not collect sensitive personal data. 3.

You have the right to withdraw such consent at any time and we will cease to process data after consent is withdrawn. 3.2 Legitimate interest Cognism processes your personal data when it is in our or our clients’ legitimate interest to do so and when these interests are not overridden by your rights.
