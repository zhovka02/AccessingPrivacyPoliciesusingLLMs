You also have the option of providing your telephone number. We collect this information when you initiate contact with us for the purpose of responding to your email or other communications.

Download Report If you choose to download a report from the Lightcast website, we may collect your first and last name and email, along with your organization. We collect this information for the purpose of providing you with the report and contacting you about your interest in Lightcast products and services. Submit a Job Application You are able to apply for jobs with Lightcast via the website.

You may also elect to provide your phone number, current employer, links to personal professional websites, references, referral information, and any additional comments and/or cover letter. We collect this information for the purpose of evaluating your candidacy and contacting you regarding your application. Information Collected via Web-Based Technology Behavioral Information Behavioral information is information about how you use our services, the areas of our site that you visit, what services you access (including what searches your conduct), and information about your computer hardware and software – including your IP address, geolocation, browser and operating system type, domain names, access times, number of visits, and referring website addresses. This information is necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services. Cookies and Web Beacons A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. Lightcast uses cookies and other similar technologies to administer our site and deliver a personalized experience for our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Lightcast also uses cookies to store non-personally identifying information about you such as past searches conducted by your computer. We do this in order to provide a better user experience (e.g., by remembering a user’s preferences when they return to the service). Lastly, Lightcast uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and improve the efficiency of our sites. Most internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware, however, that some Lightcast features or services may not function properly without cookies. Lightcast uses third party web analytics service providers to track activity on Lightcast's sites. The providers use cookies to collect information regarding our users’ visits to the sites (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Sites. The providers supply us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the sites, and to allow Lightcast to advertise our services to visitors when they navigate to other websites. Lightcast alone uses the information collected by the providers, and Lightcast does not allow any third-parties to use any of the information collected for their own purposes. How Information Is Used Respond to Your Requests We use your personal information to respond to your requests, including communications and content downloads. If you ask us to do so, Lightcast may use personal information you provide us to contact you about Lightcast products and services. Provide Services When you set up a user account for one of our licensed software products, you may choose to give us personal information such as name and email address. We will use this data solely to provide our services to you. Besides the information you provide to us when you set up your user account, our licensed software products collect only behavioral information. We use the information we gather for the purposes of providing our services, operating and improving our services, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer to jobseekers and educational institutions. Enhance Website and User Experiences We use the information regarding the use of our website to analyze and administer the site and track user movement for web analytics purposes. This website usage information enables us to provide you with an ever-improving site, service, and general offering. Manage Account If you create an account, we will use your personal information to administer the account. If necessary, we will also use your personal information to verify your identity and provide you with access to your account should you become locked out or forget your login and password. Facilitate Products and Services Career Coach Our Career Coach product provides you with career and education information to aid in choosing a career or major course of study. We use the information gathered in the same manner as described above for our licensed software products (with the addition that we may use your contact details to respond to any queries that you may have). Career Coach is a collaborative tool that brings or may bring together four separate parties to make the most of the tool. First, when you use the Career Coach tool, you are an End User of the tool and any of its associated customer services. Second, Lightcast is the company that produces the Career Coach tool and hosts it on secure web servers. When you are using the Career Coach tool, you are interacting with software that runs on Lightcast servers. Third, an organization, such as a university or private company (“the Organization”) has contracted with Lightcast for Lightcast to make Career Coach accessible in a customized format. As part Lightcast's contract with the Organization, Lightcast agrees to provide the Organization with aggregated, depersonalized demographic information gathered through the Career Coach tool. This allows the Organization to adapt to better meet the needs of its constituents. Lightcast has also agreed to provide the Organization with your personal information, when you – the End User – register on Career Coach. Fourth, third parties who provide services that are essential to delivering the Career Coach may receive information that is entered into Career Coach. These Third Parties include companies who provide internet transmission and hosting services. Lightcast may also from time-to-time make available aggregated, de-personalized demographic information, which is gathered through the Career Coach tool, to other third parties. Because of the anonymous nature of this information, it would be impossible for any third-party user of this data to relate it back to any End User to whom the data actually does relate. Skills Match Ligthcast's Skills Match tool operates very similarly to Career Coach. The relevant differences are that more Skills Match features require a login for access, and that Skills Match does not require you to provide your name when you create a login. Meet Legal and Regulatory Requirements In certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your personal information if required by law or court proceeding. We will only share the information we are required to disclose and only when we are required to do so. Security and Fraud Prevention When necessary, we will use your personal information to preserve the security of our website, systems, and personal information in our control. If necessary, we will also use your personal information to investigate possible fraud, to identify violations of this privacy policy and our terms and conditions, and to prevent any attempted harm to our users. Disclosure of Information to Others Affiliate Companies Lightcast and its affiliate companies are under the common control of KKR. Personal information you provide via the Lightcast website may be transferred or otherwise disclosed to other affiliate companies within KKR. Any such disclosures to and subsequent uses of your personal information by our affiliate companies will comply with this Statement. Support Vendors We may share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers and analyzing data. They may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way. Website and Analytics Companies We share anonymous, aggregate information regarding visitors to our website with third-party website analytics companies. These companies use this aggregate data, which has been stripped of any personally identifying information about you, to provide us with insight regarding our web usage patterns. As we only share anonymous, aggregate data, this information cannot be traced back to you individually by either us or the website analytics vendors. We use Google Analytics to provide us website usage and analytic reports, which necessitates us sharing your anonymous, aggregate data. You may choose not to share your data with Google by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which instructs your browser not to provide your website usage data to Google Analytics. To opt-out of Google Analytics, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout to install the browser add-on. Please note that installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on will only disable the use of Google Analytics and will not prevent data from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services. Customer Organizations If you use the Career Coach or Skills Match products, we will disclose your personal information to the Organization through which you are using the product. We are contractually required to share your personal information with the Organization, and by using the Career Coach or Skills Match products you consent to this disclosure. Non-Personal Information Disclosure We may aggregate on an anonymous basis behavioral information and demographic information. Such aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to the Organization, and Lightcast customers. Legal Requirements We disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith – after considering your privacy interests and other factors – that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. Because Lightcast is a U.S. company and information collected on our Sites is stored in whole or in part in the United States, your information may become subject to U.S. law. Sale of Business We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires any or all of Lightcast's business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock. In addition, in the event Lightcast becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Lightcast or its liquidator, administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party by email or through a prominent notice posted on Lightcast's website. Important Information Security You are responsible for ensuring that your account credentials (your username and password) are kept confidential. Lightcast has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. For security purposes, the information you enter in to the Career Coach should not contain any sensitive data that you would not want made available to third parties. Children Lightcast's tools are not intended for, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13. Legal Your data is submitted to Economic Modeling LLC, dba Lightcast, and is hosted and stored in a database on servers situated in the United States owned and maintained by Economic Modeling LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, whose principal place of business is at 232 N Almon St, Moscow, Idaho, USA. We process data both inside and outside the United States. It is important to know that data protection laws in the United States may not be as strong as those in your country. Where we transfer your personal information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a location outside the EEA, we will only transfer your data if an appropriate level of protection for your personal data is guaranteed, such as where we have contractual obligations to protect or transfer data with certain safeguards in place. To ensure the continued protection of your personal data while in our care, we take appropriate organizational and technical measures. In addition, we may transfer your personal data if one of the legal exceptions for such transfer can be invoked, such as with your consent or in execution of an agreement you have with us.

First, when you use the Career Coach tool, you are an End User of the tool and any of its associated customer services. Second, Lightcast is the company that produces the Career Coach tool and hosts it on secure web servers. When you are using the Career Coach tool, you are interacting with software that runs on Lightcast servers. Third, an organization, such as a university or private company (“the Organization”) has contracted with Lightcast for Lightcast to make Career Coach accessible in a customized format. As part Lightcast's contract with the Organization, Lightcast agrees to provide the Organization with aggregated, depersonalized demographic information gathered through the Career Coach tool. This allows the Organization to adapt to better meet the needs of its constituents. Lightcast has also agreed to provide the Organization with your personal information, when you – the End User – register on Career Coach. Fourth, third parties who provide services that are essential to delivering the Career Coach may receive information that is entered into Career Coach. These Third Parties include companies who provide internet transmission and hosting services. Lightcast may also from time-to-time make available aggregated, de-personalized demographic information, which is gathered through the Career Coach tool, to other third parties. Because of the anonymous nature of this information, it would be impossible for any third-party user of this data to relate it back to any End User to whom the data actually does relate.",

We use the information we gather for the purposes of providing our services, operating and improving our services, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer to jobseekers and educational institutions.\\n\\nEnhance Website and User Experiences\\nWe use the information regarding the use of our website to analyze and administer the site and track user movement for web analytics purposes. This website usage information enables us to provide you with an ever-improving site, service, and general offering.\\n\\nManage Account\\nIf you create an account, we will use your personal information to administer the account. If necessary, we will also use your personal information to verify your identity and provide you with access to your account should you become locked out or forget your login and password.\\n\\nFacilitate Products and Services\\nCareer Coach\\n\\nOur Career Coach product provides you with career and education information to aid in choosing a career or major course of study. We use the information gathered in the same manner as described above for our licensed software products (with the addition that we may use your contact details to respond to any queries that you may have).\\n\\nCareer Coach is a collaborative tool that brings or may bring together four separate parties to make the most of the tool. First, when you use the Career Coach tool, you are an End User of the tool and any of its associated customer services. Second, Lightcast is the company that produces the Career Coach tool and hosts it on secure web servers. When you are using the Career Coach tool, you are interacting with software that runs on Lightcast servers. Third, an organization, such as a university or private company (“the Organization”) has contracted with Lightcast for Lightcast to make Career Coach accessible in a customized format. As part Lightcast's contract with the Organization, Lightcast agrees to provide the Organization with aggregated, depersonalized demographic information gathered through the Career Coach tool. This allows the Organization to adapt to better meet the needs of its constituents. Lightcast has also agreed to provide the Organization with your personal information, when you – the End User – register on Career Coach. Fourth, third parties who provide services that are essential to delivering the Career Coach may receive information that is entered into Career Coach. These Third Parties include companies who provide internet transmission and hosting services. Lightcast may also from time-to-time make available aggregated, de-personalized demographic information, which is gathered through the Career Coach tool, to other third parties. Because of the anonymous nature of this information, it would be impossible for any third-party user of this data to relate it back to any End User to whom the data actually does relate.\\n\\nSkills Match\\n\\nLigthcast's Skills Match tool operates very similarly to Career Coach. The relevant differences are that more Skills Match features require a login for access, and that Skills Match does not require you to provide your name when you create a login.\\n\\nMeet Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\nIn certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your personal information if required by law or court proceeding. We will only share the information we are required to disclose and only when we are required to do so.\\n\\nSecurity and Fraud Prevention\\nWhen necessary, we will use your personal information to preserve the security of our website, systems, and personal information in our control. If necessary, we will also use your personal information to investigate possible fraud, to identify violations of this privacy policy and our terms and conditions, and to prevent any attempted harm to our users.",
