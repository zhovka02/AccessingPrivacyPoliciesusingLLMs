SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY SALUTARY DATA LLC. (“ Salutary Data ”, us ”, “ we ” or “ our ”) aggregates U.S. based business contact information (“ Professional Data ”) that is licensed to: (a) third parties for redistribution via their products and services and, (b) to end user businesses for various purposes (collectively, “ Customers ”). We are committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals about whom we collect Professional Data. This privacy policy (“ Privacy Policy ”) is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, share, safeguard, retain and delete the Professional Data and, in particular, any Personal Information (defined below) on individuals that we collect from: (a) our corporate website (the “ Website ”); (b) operation of the platform that we make available to Customers (the “ Platform ”); (c) other direct interactions with individuals, and; (d) third party data sources; and (e) service providers. 2. PERSONAL INFORMATION For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “ Personal Information ” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal Information includes information referred to as “personal data,” “personally identifiable information” and such similar references as codified in applicable data protection and privacy laws (collectively, “ Privacy Laws .”) Generally, the information that Salutary Data collects through its operations pertains to persons operating in their capacity as an owner or employee of a company or organization. Under most U.S. Privacy Laws, such information is not considered “Personal Information.” However, one U.S. state (California) and jurisdictions outside the U.S. (e.g., the United Kingdom and the European Union), do consider such information to be “Personal Information,” with certain exceptions. If you are a resident of California, please read Section 8 below. Salutary Data does not knowingly process any Personal Information concerning individuals residing, outside the United States (“ Non-U.S. Personal Data ”).

Name * Email * Company Name Title Phone Your message Notice of Collection + Ryan Tarver VP of Engineering at Salutary Data As VP of Engineering at Salutary Data, I contribute by helping build a world class technology infrastructure that provides security, automation, scalability, data as a service, and creates innovation. Building trust in pursuing optimal accuracy, accessibility, and availability for all internal and external experience needs. I believe in a culture of extreme ownership and accountability that adds to organizational health. Driving to outcomes that are results of rapid iteration and fostering an atmosphere of positivity. I have experience in developing data platforms that range from IoT to data lakes and enterprise data warehouses. I have a passion for cloud solutions that use serverless architecture and deploying advanced analytics applications with machine learning. Outside of work projects, I am constantly seeking to learn new topics in all areas of life. I frequently travel and I am looking forward to the next adventure. I am always looking for the next book or movie recommendation. + Erik Costello Knowles Director of Sales As Director of Sales, I’m charged with expanding our customer base within the Sales, Marketing, and Recruiting technology ecosystem, and supporting Salutary’s expansion into new markets. I have several years experience developing integrated data relationships with a rich variety of b2b and b2c SaaS companies, operating as a trusted data advisor to both product and business stakeholders. + Dan Schimmel Chief Product Officer & Board Chairman I began advising Salutary Data in late 2018. I’ve been a successful CEO of three information and software companies, most notably at OneSource Information Services (now part of D&B Hoovers) where I led an IPO and was an E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year. I’ve also been an active advisor, board member, and investor in early to growth stage technology companies. I’m married with three kids, am a ridiculously spoiled fan of Boston sports teams, and love to spend time on Lake Winnipesaukee in NH playing golf and fishing, albeit not very well. I am thrilled to be advising Scott and Jeff. In my opinion, you simply will not find two better people in this business. They exude integrity, trust, and competence. They have over 50 collective years of experience at some of the best-run and successful small, medium and large companies we have ever seen in our industry. These guys love what they do, and attack every day with an unusual entrepreneurial focus. And from my experience in our meetings, no detail is too small if it leads to some new innovation to create better contact data solutions for customers. I’ve seen the consistent momentum Scott and Jeff have built over the past few years. It’s not luck–It’s old-fashioned values of hard work and customer service, combined with some really new ideas and technology. I can’t wait to see how things progress in the next few years. + Custom Pricing Inquiry Let's start the conversation on custom pricing. Name * Email * Company Name Title Phone Your message + Ryan Quinn VP of Partnerships & Sales As the VP of Partnerships & Sales at Salutary Data, I am responsible for our network of partners and clients and planning and executing our GTM strategy for long term growth. For the past 14 years I’ve been in B2B Data, Lead-Gen, and Sales Intel, and built relationships and deep knowledge of use cases and profit driven strategies of customers. I spend a lot of time understanding clients’ data strategy and needs, and enjoy creating mutually beneficial commercial agreements. My favorite part of entrepreneurship is thinking outside the box and developing new lines of revenue and product offerings based on client feedback and budding market demands. Favorite quote: “I learned quickly that the harder I worked, the more success I would have.” – Cam Hanes Outside of working from home, I spend time with my wife and two younger kids. Hobbies include golf, cooking (with emphasis on eating ; ), travel, and I’m not afraid of an IPA or the right type of Bourbon. + Lauren Nassif Director of Business Operations As the Director of Business Operations, I am a Swiss army knife at Salutary Data. My day-to-day responsibilities range from analyzing and interrogating our data, assisting our clients to meet their strategic goals, improving our processes and working with our vendors and suppliers. I am inherently curious and this drives me to dig into our data, understand the quality and help provide the best records to our customers. I am truly passionate about building teams and helping others reach their goals, which is why this role and this organization are a perfect fit. When I am not consumed in data you can find me on a boat in Maine, traveling in Europe or playing as much soccer as my body will allow. + Company Qualities On the company front, the owners – Jeff and Scott – are accessible to customers and customized files are delivered nimbly and precisely. Customers reap the benefit of their over 50+ years of experience including how to best address their target audiences as well as ways to mine the best, right data for given use cases. On the one hand, they are no nonsense and they tell like it is. On the other, you’ll find interactions are light-hearted with the aim to relieve daily pressures but with a mindfulness of the work at hand. On a given day, you may encounter hippie speak like “groovey” or email responses with google images that simply make you smile. + Scott Gordon CEO, Co-founder Professional I consider myself a partnership guy who’s honed his trade and style over the course of time. I’m a Ury-Fisher disciple – the guys who wrote “Getting to Yes” – a principles-based negotiation approach based on optimizing win/win outcomes. Our data suppliers, quality vetting vendors, and customers all represent a wonderful ecosystem to me and I believe strongly that we’re all in it together. As CEO of Salutary Data, I’m customer facing and charged with our business growth and overall plan execution. My 25 years in B2B, and licensing and general manager roles have led me to understand that I like value creation best. Thus, building Salutary Data is my mission. We’re doing it and it’s working. I hope YOU will become part of this. Scott is Singing the Pooh Bear Hummy Song When… his customer acknowledges the value, and effort, provided by Salutary Data; a new partnership is struck; I’m interrogating data in a spreadsheet; I’m mentoring or helping someone in the industry. When He’s Not Working and off the Grid, Scott is… On the side of the baseball grid watching my guy throwing off the mound; listening to my other son playing guitar; embracing chlorine with my wife and in a rigorous cardiovascular way (i.e. masters swimming), soft surface tennis, Sudoku, day start with my Peet’s, offset on a good day with a craft IPA. + Jeff Crewley CTO, Co-founder My work centers around the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship where I get energy from the startup process and connection to the people and systems that make it work. As CTO of Salutary Data, my focus is on attending to the needs and problems of our customers. This includes mining contacts with very specific criteria, developing processes to smoothly integrate and categorize contacts, and efficiently creating and delivering data sets with tens of millions of records. I love the experimental and iterative process both in terms of wrestling complex challenges into submission as well as finding new ways to solve problems and increase quality. My greatest satisfaction comes when our clients feel we’ve met or exceeded their expectations. Outside of the office, you will find me spending time with my family, renovating (300 year!) old houses, and traveling near (Vermont and Maine) and far (Europe and around the US). I also study Revolutionary-era history, and even enjoy a morning mucking out horse stalls with my wife and kids. + Business Attributes Business-wise, Salutary Data removes considerable business and technical overhead from its customers in terms of real labor and technology resources. Specifically, our sourcing and screening expertise, agnostic testing and verifying of data, field enrichment and normalization, and timely delivery of custom files lets you do what you do best while leaning on us for our Highly Curated Contact TM data and services. Business relationships are based on fairness in terms of pricing and risk sharing. This manifests itself in responsive and flexible price structures based on an understanding of customers’ business and outcomes that advance the profits of both parties. Finally, our product works! Competitively, it’s top tier and simply stated gets to buyers and influencers whether thru phone or email outreach. +",
