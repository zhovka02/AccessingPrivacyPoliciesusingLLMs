We are a marketing company whose clients range from some of the biggest companies and charities in the United States to local charities, such as food banks. We help our clients identify people who might be interested in their marketing offers and help our clients analyze and improve their marketing practices. In other words, we create audiences and help our clients make better marketing decisions. To do this, we study consumer characteristics and then make predictions about the products, services and causes in which individuals are likely to be interested. We match those interests against the marketing goals of our clients to find the best fit. Sometimes our research is intended to help our clients find new donors or customers, and other times to find new ways to serve or connect with existing donors or customers. But whether they are our clients, the American consumer, or others, we care about people. This Privacy Choices page, describes ways that United States consumers can submit their privacy choices to us. We offer United States consumers the right to request to opt-out of our sharing of their personal information, the right to request that we delete their personal information and the right to request to access the personal information we store about them, as more fully described below. In some states, such as California, these are legal rights for residents of the state. The page below contains important information about what these privacy choices are, how to submit privacy choices to us, and other important information about legal rights some consumers hold, depending on their state of residence. Please carefully review the information below so you understand more about what personal information we collect, how we use it, your privacy choices and how to submit privacy choices. If you just want to exercise your privacy choices, please skip below to the section titled, “How to Submit Your Privacy Choices.” What Data We Collect and How We Use It What we do is complex, and it has an impact on consumer privacy. We would like to take a moment to explain how we protect your privacy. We don’t release information to third parties concerning specific items that a consumer has purchased, what magazines they read, or what charities they support unless requested by the organization with whom the consumer has the relationship, or if required by law. What We Seek to Do – Marketing Products and Services We try to help our clients tailor their advertising to the consumers most likely interested in their product, service or cause and to help our clients analyze and improve their marketing. To do this, we match our clients’ customer information to a specific consumer by comparing name and postal address or other offline identifiers or email address or other online identifiers. We are then able to associate a consumer or a de-identified consumer profile with other data, including demographic data, social media informed data, geographic data, transaction data and transaction-based insights, and other interest-based data. We analyze the data we have about consumers, such as purchase, subscription or donation information, demographic information, social media interests and other consumer information, using statistical models designed to predict consumer interest in specific offers from particular businesses and non-profit causes or in categories of product, service or cause. Our models predict not only who might be interested in our clients’ offers but which consumers are likely to have little or no interest in them. This can help improve our clients’ marketing decisions, which helps reduce the amount of irrelevant advertising consumers see and saves our clients money. Once we complete our analysis, we provide our clients with the results in a format designed for the way they intend to use it. For example, when clients use our products to send direct mail or to better understand likely interests of their existing customers or donors, we typically provide our clients information associated with names and postal addresses or other individually identifying information. When our clients ask for help to connect with potentially interested consumers through digital channels, such as online or mobile advertising, we would typically provide our products in de-identified form using industry standard privacy practices. In these cases, we, or our client, or partner will combine the results of our analyses with digital identifiers in the applicable digital channel (such as with cookie IDs or other identifiers for web advertising, device IDs for mobile advertising or email addresses for email advertising). When our clients want information or recommendations about how to improve the effectiveness of their marketing, we may use our analysis to create aggregated reports about their customers or donors or about groups of consumers and their interests relative to the client’s product, service or cause. We grant our clients rights to use the data we provide that are calibrated to the type of marketing they do, the marketing channels they use and the way they need to use the data for those purposes. The rights our clients receive to use the consumer data we provide them are limited by the terms of our contract with them. Although usually these rights are not the permanent right to use the information, some state laws may define these licenses as a “sale” or as “sharing” of consumer information that is subject to certain rights to opt out of the sale or the sharing (please see Your Privacy Choices – Opt Out Rights , below, for more information on the choices we offer to consumers to opt out of our sharing your information with our clients). Some U.S. states have more recently defined as “sensitive” certain types of data that are commonly used for affirmative marketing to tailor offers to consumers who are most likely to be interested in them. Examples of this type of information include racial or ethnic origin, nationality and religion or religious affiliation. Marketers routinely use basic demographic information to ensure that consumers are aware of opportunities, causes, and products very likely to be important to them because of the groups to which they belong or with which they affiliate. For example, religious organizations often seek donations from those who express interest in causes related to a particular religious affiliation. Here the intent is clear: to find people belonging to or sympathetic to a particular religious belief or denomination in order to effectively communicate with them for the betterment of the group. Similarly, commercial organizations frequently seek to study the make-up of their customer base and to develop products and marketing offers that will appeal to racial or ethnic groups that are under-represented in their customer base. The intent is not to discriminate, but rather to be more inclusive. We seek to support our clients’ efforts to pursue affirmative, tailored advertising like the examples just mentioned, and where permitted by law, we may process this type of basic demographic information as part of doing so. Note, please see the section below titled “Information Related to Our Business or Employee Relationships” for information on how we collect and use other types of information that is not integrated into our marketing products and services. What We Seek to Avoid We do not knowingly collect information about consumers that has historically been considered highly sensitive in the United States such as credit card or bank account numbers, Social Security numbers or other government-issued identifiers or HIPAA data or other information specifying a consumer’s medical conditions. We don’t work with clients whose offers or businesses we consider pornographic, fraudulent or harmful to families. We don’t work with clients we believe engage in illegal discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, veteran status, sex or any other legally protected status. We implement and enforce internal policies and procedures designed to avoid working with these types of marketers. We do not accept or generate information specifying individuals’ health conditions (such as protected health information, aka “HIPAA data”) and do not seek to predict that any person has a particular health condition. We do serve clients that sell health-related products, which can range from non-prescription items such as maternity apparel and vitamins and supplements to prescription drugs. In all cases, our predictions are designed to identify those with likely interest in a product or service, and not a specific medical condition. In other words, we predict whether a person may be interested in buying these types of products (for themselves or others), but we do it without individual health information and do not predict that a person has a particular health condition on behalf of our clients or partners. In these cases, our predictive technology would seek to identify interest in the product, which might include consumers with a particular health condition and also consumers without the health condition. For example, for retailers selling maternity apparel, our predictive models seek to predict interest in that type of apparel, which will likely include those who are expectant parents (which we would not know), but also those who are not expectant parents (which we also would not know) but are likely to buy for other reasons, for example as a gift for others. In every case we strive to identify and follow industry best practices around consumer privacy and ethical use of data when making these predictions. We don’t work with our clients on offers relative to marketing for products or services that are meant for those with health conditions we consider to be highly sensitive, such as sexually transmitted diseases or cancer. Please note, our marketing products and services are designed only for use in marketing to United States consumers above the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information about consumers residing in other locations (such as Europe) or about children. How We Protect Consumer Data We work with a lot of consumer data, so you may be interested in how we protect it. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard the security of all of the consumer information in our custody. We align our security with the NIST-800-53 privacy and security controls published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and engage an external security audit firm to test our security against these standards annually. How Long We Retain Data How long we retain consumer information depends on a number of factors. Much of the consumer personal information that we collect is used for marketing products and services, to help our clients and for other purposes described above. For information we hold on behalf of our clients or third party providers of information, the retention period is based on the terms of the contract with them, and we delete their information when required by contract or applicable law, and for our clients when requested. When we identify consumer data that we believe is no longer used for making marketing predictions, we delete it, and we periodically conduct reviews to identify consumer information we should delete. Some data related to our products and services is archived for a period of time in case we should need it again to serve our clients or for business continuity or disaster recovery purposes. Although there is not always a specific time period we will retain the archived information, generally the length of time we retain it depends on considerations such as how long we may need it to serve our clients and availability of system resources, and this type of information is generally retained for less than fourteen months. Categories of Personal Information Collected and Shared in the Past 12 Months Please see the table referenced at the bottom of this page for a list of the following with respect to the categories of personal information that we have collected in the past 12 months for use in our marketing products and services. This lists includes separate information relative to our collection, use and sharing of categories specifically designated as “sensitive” personal information under the privacy laws of some states. the categories and descriptions of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which the information was collected, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, the categories of third parties to whom personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose. Your Privacy Choices and Your California Privacy Rights We believe in honoring individuals’ choices regarding use of their personal information. We are consumers too, and we care deeply about our own privacy and about how our company is perceived. We believe that almost everyone wants to receive offers that are relevant and valuable to them, but that individuals also may want the choice not to receive tailored advertising. We participate in a number of trade associations, like the DAA and the DMA division of the ANA, whose self-regulatory programs we follow; they require that businesses recognize and honor consumer choice. Accordingly, we offer you several potential privacy choices, which are described below, along with how you may submit these requests. For consumers in some states (such as California and Virginia), these choices correspond to legal rights under applicable law, and these rights are described in more detail below. Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, we do not disclose information of consumers from whom we directly collect data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the consumer has opted out, and we provide a cost-free means for consumers to opt out of any such sharing through this page. Please note that the descriptions below primarily apply to information we collect about individuals as it is used to produce the marketing products and services we provide. California residents have certain rights relative to business-related information or HR information we hold. Please see the section below titled “Information Related to Our Business or Employee Relationships” for an explanation of what type of information this is and how the privacy choices listed below apply to that information and may be exercised. Opt-Out Requests “Opt out” is a frequently used term, but what it means and how it is implemented may differ among states and across companies. In some states, such as California and Virginia, it corresponds to a legal right for residents of that state referred to as the “sale opt-out” or “do not share” or “do not sell” right. At its core, however, to opt out is to make a choice about how companies use and share your personal information. And we listen and seek to respect your opt-out choice. We provide a mechanism below for you to opt out of our sharing your personal information for tailored advertising. The DMA division of the ANA also maintains consumer opt-out solutions for direct mail and email offers, found at www.DMAChoice.org . We regularly update our records with information from these sources and seek to honor the consumers’ choices when creating our marketing products and services. The industry-standard opt-out for online behavioral advertising is another excellent way to make your choice in the context of online behavioral advertising. When you use one of these opt-out tools—and there are links to them below under “Other Privacy Choices And Opt-Out Solutions” —your browser will be recognized via a web cookie or using mobile device identifiers or other technical identifiers to signify your choice. This allows companies that serve display ads to check for the presence of those cookies or identifiers before determining whether you wish to be presented with a targeted ad on the browser or device. If not, they will typically display a random or generic ad or an ad based on the type of web page where the ad is being shown instead. We seek to work with companies that recognize and honor these browser-based and device-based opt-out solutions. These browser-based and device-based opt-out solutions have their limitations. Cookies are temporary, browser-specific, and device-specific. If you clear your cookies, if your anti-virus software clears your cookies, if your browser is set not to accept third-party cookies, if you use a second browser, or if you use a different device to view the Web, then some of these browser or device-based opt-out solutions will not always reliably stop you from seeing interest-based advertising. As improved tools are developed to be more comprehensive, we will evaluate them and expect the industry groups to which we belong will implement updated standards and tools. It is important to recognize what these marketing opt-out options will not do. They do not preclude a particular company or organization that you have dealt with in the past from sending you their marketing offers, including those that are combined or associated with a digital identifier you use. This works well for most people, because they have a voluntary, mutually-beneficial relationship with those companies that they have dealt with previously. Those who prefer not to receive offers from a particular company need to contact the company directly and ask that they not receive any future marketing materials from them. Opting-out also will not prevent your information from being used for analyses we do internally where individual consumer information is not provided to our clients, such as when we produce aggregated marketing reports for our clients. If you wish for your information not to be used for aggregated reports, please request that we delete your information (please see “Deletion Requests,” below). During calendar year 2022, we received a total of 2,794 requests to opt-out, of which we complied with 2,423 in whole or in part and denied 371 due to failure of the requester to sufficiently authenticate the requester’s or the individual’s identity. The mean number of days to substantively respond to these opt-out requests was 4.4. In addition to marketing opt-out options, we also extend two additional privacy choices to consumers about how we use, share and retain their information. In some states, such as California or Virginia, these may be referred to as the “deletion right” and the “access right” or “right to know.” Deletion Requests You have a right to request that we delete your personal information that we have collected. In some states, such as California and Virginia, this corresponds to a legal right for residents of that state. If we deny a deletion request because we cannot sufficiently verify your identity (see below under “Identity Verification Process” for information on how and why we verify identity of those submitting privacy choices), we also likely will not be able to treat the deletion request as an opt-out because we use the same method of determining identity for both purposes. We may retain limited pieces of personal information after a verified deletion request is received in several circumstances. We will retain your contact information such as name, postal address or email address following a verified deletion request solely in order to try to ensure that we do not re-insert information about you into our systems (other than information that would be used to continue to recognize your privacy choice) if we receive your personal information from another source in the future. This allows us to fulfill our legal obligation to you and better reflect your privacy choice. We may retain your personal information if required to deliver a service to you that you request from us. We may also retain your personal information if required or permitted by law or legal proceedings (for example if required by a legal subpoena we have received or to prevent or detect fraud). We treat all deletion requests as opt-out requests as well. During calendar year 2022, we received a total of 175 deletion requests, of which we complied with 150 in whole or in part and denied 25 due to failure of the requester to sufficiently authenticate the requester’s or the individual’s identity. The mean number of days to substantively respond to these deletion requests was 5.0. Access Requests You have a right to request that Wiland disclose (1) the categories of personal information about you that Wiland collects, discloses and sells within the twelve months preceding your verified request (or in some cases, information dating back to January 1, 2022, if longer), (2) the categories of party from whom your personal information was collected during that time period, (3) the categories of party to whom the information was disclosed for a business purpose or shared/sold during that period, and (4) the business purposes for which your personal information was collected or disclosed. You also have the right to request that Wiland disclose the specific pieces of your personal information Wiland maintains about you. In some states, such as California and Virginia, this corresponds to a legal right for residents of the state, which may be referred to as the “right to know,” “disclosure right” or “access right.” During calendar year 2022, we received a total of two access requests, of which we complied with one in whole or in part and denied one due to failure of the requester to sufficiently authenticate the requester’s or the individual’s identity. The mean number of days to substantively respond to these access requests was 60.7. Correction Requests Some states, such as California and Virginia, extend to consumers the right to correct inaccurate information that businesses hold, in certain circumstances. As permitted by law, we have determined that various aspects of our business, such as the volume of consumer data we process, how our systems are architected to receive, utilize and analyze the data, and the number of sources of that data, do not permit us to practicably receive and give effect to consumer-provided correction requests. Therefore, if you wish to correct information we have about you, you must instead submit a request that we delete your information. Please see “Deletion Requests,” above. Limit the Processing of Data Defined As Sensitive in Some States As discussed above, we do not process data historically defined as highly-sensitive in the United States. However, recently some states have defined certain types of data routinely used by marketers for affirmative, tailored marketing as sensitive. Where permitted by law, we may have certain of these types of data. As permitted by law, we have determined that various aspects of our business, such as the volume of consumer data we process, how our systems utilize and analyze the data, and the number of sources of that data, do not permit us to practicably receive and give effect to consumer-provided requests to limit processing of sensitive data. Instead, if you wish to opt out of our processing this type of information, you must instead submit a request that we delete your information. Please see “Deletion Requests,” above. Information Related to Our Business or Employee Relationships We may also collect and use your personal information in the context of an existing or potential business relationship with our company (for example, if you work for one of our vendors, partners or clients or for an organization with whom we may establish a relationship) (we’ll refer to this as “business-related information”) or for our human resources functions (such as for our relationship with our employees, former employees, job applicants and their dependents) (we’ll refer to this as “HR information”). For more information on how we collect and process business-related information, please see our privacy policy at www.Wiland.com/privacy-policies and for more information on how we collect and process HR information, please see www.Wiland.com/applicant-and-employee-privacy-notice. Under most state consumer privacy laws, the rights described above that correspond to those laws do not apply to business-related information or HR information. However, under the California Consumer Privacy Act, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request the rights described above relative to these types of information as well, beginning on January 1, 2023. Because we do not “sell” or “share” HR information for cross-context behavioral advertising, as those terms are defined under the CCPA, we do not offer opt-out rights with respect to that information. We also do not typically “sell” or “share” business information for cross-context behavioral advertising. However, we allow certain service providers to analyze information relative to vendor, partner or service provider payments with which they assist us for their own analytic or product development purposes (but they commit not to share any such information in individually identifiable form outside their organization for these purposes). If you are a California resident and are associated with one of our vendors, partners or service providers, please email privacy@wiland.com (or call our toll-free number below) if you wish to request to opt out of this usage, and specify in your message the Wiland vendor, partner or service provider with which you are associated. If you are a California resident, you have the right to request deletion or correction of business-related information or HR information we have about you. We will not delete business-related information we have about you if it relates to a current relationship (such as with a current business partner, vendor or service provider or client) because we may have legal obligations to retain it and because we use it for business purposes associated with the ongoing business relationship with which it was collected and is associated. We also may not delete HR information relating to you due to legal obligations or business purposes for which we need that information for our ongoing human resources processes — please see below for a description of how California residents may submit requests to delete or correct their information so that our Human Resources team can explain what information we will and will not delete or correct. Please also note that unlike consumer information related to our marketing products and services, deletion of business-related information or HR information may not prevent our receiving the information in the future from another source and processing it for our legitimate business purposes, to the extent consistent with applicable law. California residents may also request to access copies of their business-related information and HR information. California residents should submit privacy choices for deletion rights and access rights relative to business-related information in the same manner as for other information, as described below under “How to Submit Your Privacy Choices.” For HR information, California residents should submit their privacy choices to our Human Resources Department by email to HumanResources@wiland.com . How to Submit Your Privacy Choices To submit your opt-out, deletion or access request, select the hyperlink below that corresponds to the request you are making and the person whose privacy choice is being made. Our privacy choices hyperlinks listed below link to web forms that contain instructions detailing the information we will need to verify your identity, depending on the type of privacy choice you are making and whether you are the individual for whom the privacy choice is being made. In some cases family members or authorized third parties may submit privacy choices for an individual, and in some states, such as California, this is a legal right. Reminder, if you wish to have us correct personal information or to limit our processing of data defined by some states as sensitive (e.g., data revealing race, ethnicity or religious affiliation), please submit a request to delete personal information using the applicable form, below. I want to opt out of marketing programs or delete personal information for myself I want to access my own personal information I want to opt out of marketing programs or delete personal information for a family member I want to access personal information for a family member I am a third-party authorized to make privacy choices on behalf of a consumer Alternatively, you can call, toll-free, 1-833-794-5263, to submit privacy choices by telephone. For HR information, California residents should submit their privacy choices to our Human Resources Department by email to HumanResources@wiland.com . Identity Verification Process In order to protect consumer privacy, we conduct an identity verification process to seek to properly verify the identity of parties who submit privacy choices to us. We want to simultaneously respect individuals’ privacy choices while seeking to avoid someone fraudulently submitting a privacy choice or unauthorized parties obtaining your personal information. The particular verification we require for a request depends on our assessment of the risk of what is being requested. The chart below describes the verification we use for particular requests based on who is submitting the request and what is being requested, and instructions in each of our privacy choices web forms listed above give specific details on what must be submitted and how to submit it. What are you requesting? Who are you relative to the individual whose privacy choice is being submitted? I am the individual I am an immediate family member of the individual I am an authorized agent I have a power of attorney for the individual pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000 to 4465 Opt-Out Request A A, B A, E Deletion Request Access Request A, C A, D Correction Request A (submit as Deletion Request) A, B (submit as Deletion Request) A, E (submit as Deletion Request) Request to Limit Processing of “Sensitive Information” A (submit as Deletion Request) A, B (submit as Deletion Request) A, E (submit as Deletion Request) A – Submit accurate contact information (name, postal address, email, telephone number, etc.) for the individual (if you are the individual submitting your own privacy choice, this is your information).

Authorized Agent You may designate an authorized agent to make opt-out, deletion, and access requests on your behalf. Additional documentation is required for this type of submission, as described above. Other Privacy Choices and Opt-Out Solutions It is important to point out that the privacy choices described above apply specifically to Wiland and the personal information that Wiland collects about you. We do not control the privacy practices and marketing of other companies, therefore if you would like for your privacy choices to apply to other organizations or to their data that we may hold as their service provider, then you will need to reach out directly to the other organizations and submit your requests. If you opt out of marketing with us, you will likely continue to get interest based advertising offers originating from other organizations. To decrease interest based advertising contacts you should not only opt out with us but also through other services. Some of the major opt-out services are: Digital Advertising Alliance DMAchoice.org Network Advertising Alliance America is not a perfect place, but it is a wonderful place. The Internet is not a perfect community, but it is incredibly valuable to many aspects of our lives. The post office and direct mail aren’t perfect either, but they do a lot of good. Marketing enables written communication that raises millions for charity, brings excellent magazines and newspapers to avid readers, and delivers offers for new and better goods and services that consumers enjoy. We are proud to be a part of this, and we are devoted to serving everyone well, both our clients and consumers.

We are then able to associate a consumer or a de-identified consumer profile with other data, including demographic data, social media informed data, geographic data, transaction data and transaction-based insights, and other interest-based data. We analyze the data we have about consumers, such as purchase, subscription or donation information, demographic information, social media interests and other consumer information, using statistical models designed to predict consumer interest in specific offers from particular businesses and non-profit causes or in categories of product, service or cause. Our models predict not only who might be interested in our clients’ offers but which consumers are likely to have little or no interest in them. This can help improve our clients’ marketing decisions, which helps reduce the amount of irrelevant advertising consumers see and saves our clients money.\n\nOnce we complete our analysis, we provide our clients with the results in a format designed for the way they intend to use it. For example, when clients use our products to send direct mail or to better understand likely interests of their existing customers or donors, we typically provide our clients information associated with names and postal addresses or other individually identifying information.
