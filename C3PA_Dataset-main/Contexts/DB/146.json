To review the “California Addendum” we have created specifically to address disclosures required under the California Privacy Rights Act, please see our “ CPRA PRIVACY NOTICE ” which is an addendum to this Privacy Notice . (Formerly known as the California Consumer Privacy Act.) To “opt out” of our databases – which means we will no longer “sell” and will instead suppress the personal information we have associated with you, please see Section 13 . To learn about personal information that we collect from our own Clients – e.g., the organizations that we work with, or business prospects for our own Services – please see Section 7 . Background About Our Services Webbula provides a variety of data services to advertisers, marketers and other organizations.  Generally, these services (our “Services”) are designed to help these organizations market to and communicate with their consumers and prospective consumers, or others that may wish to interact with their organizations (for instance, donors, where the organization is a charitable organization).   Sometimes we have a direct relationship with these organizations.  At other times, we have an indirect relationship with them, such as through another data or advertising platform, or a reseller, or an agency that engages on behalf of their own client.   We refer to all end users as “Clients,” whether they are brands, data or ad platforms, agencies or other types of organizations. Our Services are described in more depth in this Privacy Notice:   they often involve either (a) performing “hygiene” on the consumer information our Clients have – for instance, to correct inaccuracies and prevent fraud, (b) helping organizations to maintain and expand their consumer or donor base, and (c) helping organizations better reach, target and communicate with consumers or donors online or through other marketing channels. We often collect consumer information, including information known as “personal information” or “personal data” under state privacy laws, from other companies who have a direct (or indirect) relationship with the consumer at issue.   We therefore often do not have a direct relationship with the consumer:  rather, we often act as a data intermediary, between either multiple “first parties” who do have relationships with the consumer, or “first” and “third” parties who wish to do so. As we have described elsewhere in this Privacy Notice, in order to “opt out” of our databases – which means we will no longer “sell” and will instead suppress the information we have associated with you, please see Section 13 . To learn about information that we collect from our own Clients – e.g., the organizations that we work with, or business prospects for our own Services – please see Section 7 . The Information That We Collect and Use in Our Services In order to provide and operate our Services, we collect certain personal information.  Under some state privacy statutes, this information is referred to as “personal information,” and in other states “personal data.”  Some statutes refer to it (or certain such data) as “personally identifiable information.”  We use the term “personal information” for purposes of this Privacy Notice to refer to that type of information, and we use the term “the Information” to refer to the personal information that we collect in providing our Services. We describe this personal below, in tabular form (which we do because certain statutes encourage or favor that type of presentation). The tables below explain the categories of information we collect and the purposes for which we use them.  Further detail about each of the purposes is set out in the “Additional Information on Purposes” table below.  Our descriptions of “Identifiers” follow common statutory, categorical examples:  we do not necessarily collect all example types of all identifiers shown. Categories of personal information we collect Purposes of use Sources of Information Identifiers E.g., name; alias; postal address; online identifiers; IP address; telephone number; email address, mobile ad identifiers.

When we do this, we work with a data partner that “matches” our or other Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to help brands and other organizations target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. Assisting Clients in creating “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).

Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases.

We may aggregate or deidentify your information and may use, share, rent or sell aggregated or deidentified information for any purpose, and such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. How We Share Information with Third Parties, including Service Providers Webbula may share the Information with Clients, marketing services and platforms, as well as service providers that help us to provide the Services we’ve described above (or other services we may add in the future).  This includes sharing in the following ways: With Our Clients: We license your information in various ways to our Clients (and sometimes to partners and resellers, who license the Information to their Client), when we provide our Services.  We may sometimes share your information with those Clients’ service providers (for instance, a provider that sends communications for or on behalf of a Client, including their own customer). With Our Advertisers and Partners: We also may share the Information, including personally identifiable information and Audience Segments, with business and data partners to help provide more tailored targeted marketing, advertising and communications. Likewise, we may do so for analytical purposes, including to help these other parties measure campaign performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze, or segregate this Information on our or our Clients’ behalf. With Our Service Providers: We share your information with a variety of service providers in order to operate, protect and advertise our Services and maintain our website(s).  For instance, we may share the Information with tech and Client support providers, marketing and advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance or verify your information), security vendors, payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies help us deliver or develop Services. Corporate transfers: If Webbula, its stock or its significant assets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our information will be transferred to that entity, and may be shared during due diligence in anticipation of any such transaction. Affiliates, parent companies and subsidiaries: Webbula may share some or all of the Information in our possession with any affiliated or subsidiary companies (if we ever have any). As required by law or to protect any person or entity: Webbula may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply in good faith with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Webbula, our Clients, or any other person or entity. Your Marketing and Opt-Out Choices There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you: First, you may visit our “opt out” page at https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/ to have your personal information removed from our database. We will then remove your personal information from our active marketing databases We may in certain cases request additional information, if required. If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising), you can also visit the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages. Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike Webbula’s direct opt-out.  Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.  Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you. If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – such as if you are a Client or prospective Client of ours and we send information about our Services — you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails. Cookies and Similar Technologies Cookies and How We Use Them While Webbula does not generally use cookies (for instance, third party cookies) in providing its Services to Clients, on this website Webbula its business partners do use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functioning technologies, which we describe below. Our partners, on the other hand, may use cookies and similar technologies in their own marketing services.  We thus may work with third parties or service providers to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form.   These business and platform partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies. Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.  When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.  Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.  When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.   Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.

Children’s Privacy Our online services are not intended for children, and Webbula provides no products or service geared towards children.

Changes to this Privacy Policy From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy.  Any changes to it will become effective when it is posted to our website.  Please check back to learn of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Storage of Information in the United States If you are accessing our website from outside of the United States, your connection likely will be through and to servers located in the United States and all Information you provide will likely be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States.  (We generally store the Information used in our Services in the United States.)   Thus, you should be aware that in accessing this website or otherwise communicating with us, the Information we collect or receive from you may be subject to laws with lesser or different privacy standards than those in your own country (such as if you are in a country located in the European Union). Your Privacy Rights Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information.  For example, under several state laws (as they become effective), you may be able to ask us to: provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible update or correct your information delete certain information restrict the use of your information We will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law. Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. Do Not Sell :  First, consumers may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  (This is required in some states, but we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.)   Those laws may broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include allowing third parties, such as advertisers, advertising networks, to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address, device identifiers or other hashed identifiers, interests, browsing behavior and/or other activity to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you. Depending on the consumer (and depending on whether the consumer is a Client of ours or a member of the public with whom we lack a direct relationship), we may disclose the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale (as defined by applicable law): identification and demographics; inference data, such as whether you may be likely to purchase certain goods in the near future. To opt out of this type of sale, please go to https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/ and follow the instructions on that web page. Do Not Share/Do Not Target :  Consumers also may opt out “targeted” advertising, which is also sometimes referred to as “interest based” or “personalized” advertising.  We refer to it here as “targeted” advertising.  (It is also referred to as “cross-context” advertising under California law.) (This “opt out” right is required in some states, but again, we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.) We do not directly control the sending or initiation of targeted advertising, which is generally performed with cookies and similar technologies.  However, we do sometimes provide personal information that is used in association with cookies and similar technologies for cross-context advertising. In turn, to opt out of this type of targeting, you may request that we not “sell” your Information ( see above instructions ).   When you do so we will cease providing your Information for purposes of cross-context advertising.  You may also visit industry websites such as those operated by the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) , which provide cookie-based opt-outs in respect to cross-context advertising.  (These opt-out solutions are generally cookie-based and specific to a particular browser, so if you switch browsers, or clear your cookies, you will generally need to refresh your opt-out.).  Finally, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, the providers we work with may recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws. In addition, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, we will recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws. Finally, although we do not obtain mobile device information, we work with business partners who may associate the personal information we provide to them with mobile ad identifiers.  You may opt-out of cross-context advertising or targeting performed by these companies through the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this type of opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). Also, you may visit https://youradchoices.com/appchoices to download the AppChoices Tool to control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device and https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/ for more information and instructions on opting out on mobile devices. Accessing the Personal Information We Have About You In certain states you may have a right to “access” or “know” about the specific information we hold about you, such as to deliver our Services.   If you would like to request access of your personal information , you may do so by contacting us at 888-993-2285 ext 4 or you may visit our “Data Access Request” page at https://webbula.com/ca-eu-data-request/ . For security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be. Authorized Agents If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of Webbula’s use of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so as outlined on the following page: https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/ Sensitive Data Some states, like Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia, provide their residents (upon the applicable effective dates), the right to opt-in to the processing of their sensitive personal information or personal data.

For instance, we share the Information with tech and customer support providers, marketing and advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance or verify our Information), security and data hygiene vendors, payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies that may help us deliver or develop Services.\\nWe may share the Information to communicate with you and market to you, including through email, direct mail or display media (which in turn may rely on cookies and similar technologies, described elsewhere in this Privacy Notice, including in Section 6).\\nWe will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect the rights, safety or property of ourselves or any person or entity. We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose any Information to the requesting agency in doing so.\\nIf we or all or substantially all of our assets, are purchased by another company (such as in a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of stock and/or assets, or other corporate change or financing transaction), the Information in our possession will likely be transferred to the successor entity. We also may share the Information during the course of any due diligence process leading up to any such transaction.\\nOur website(s) use cookies and similar technologies, both for its internal and operational purposes and to market to you (such as to retarget ads to you when you visit other sites across the Internet).\\n\\nLinks\\nThis website may provide links to other websites that Webbula thinks users will find interesting or useful.  For instance, if we present information about a webinar by another company. Webbula is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites or companies.\n\nSecurity and Data Integrity\nWebbula uses various electronic, physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to protect and limit access to the information you provided to us via this online service. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure; you therefore should not rely on our (or any) security protocols to be foolproof. Additionally, please note that information you send to us electronically may not be secure when it is transmitted to us because we do not control the security of your delivery channel.\n\\nChildren’s Privacy\nOur online services are not intended for children, and Webbula provides no products or service geared towards children. Our website at www.webbula.com does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information online from children under age 18.\n\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\nFrom time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy.  Any changes to it will become effective when it is posted to our website.  Please check back to learn of any changes to this Privacy Policy.\n\\nStorage of Information in the United States\nIf you are accessing our website from outside of the United States, your connection likely will be through and to servers located in the United States and all Information you provide will likely be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States.  (We generally store the Information used in our Services in the United States.)   Thus, you should be aware that in accessing this website or otherwise communicating with us, the Information we collect or receive from you may be subject to laws with lesser or different privacy standards than those in your own country (such as if you are in a country located in the European Union).\n\nYour Privacy Rights\nDepending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information.  For example, under several state laws (as they become effective), you may be able to ask us to:\n\nprovide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible\nupdate or correct your information\ndelete certain information\nrestrict the use of your information\nWe will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law. Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.\n\nDo Not Sell:  First, consumers may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  (This is required in some states, but we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.)   Those laws may broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include allowing third parties, such as advertisers, advertising networks, to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address, device identifiers or other hashed identifiers, interests, browsing behavior and/or other activity to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you.\n\\nDepending on the consumer (and depending on whether the consumer is a Client of ours or a member of the public with whom we lack a direct relationship), we may disclose the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale (as defined by applicable law):\n\nidentification and demographics;\ninference data, such as whether you may be likely to purchase certain goods in the near future.\nTo opt out of this type of sale, please go to https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/ and follow the instructions on that web page.\n\nDo Not Share/Do Not Target:  Consumers also may opt out “targeted” advertising, which is also sometimes referred to as “interest based” or “personalized” advertising.  We refer to it here as “targeted” advertising.  (It is also referred to as “cross-context” advertising under California law.) (This “opt out” right is required in some states, but again, we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.)\n\nWe do not directly control the sending or initiation of targeted advertising, which is generally performed with cookies and similar technologies.  However, we do sometimes provide personal information that is used in association with cookies and similar technologies for cross-context advertising.\n\nIn turn, to opt out of this type of targeting, you may request that we not “sell” your Information (see above instructions).   When you do so we will cease providing your Information for purposes of cross-context advertising.  You may also visit industry websites such as those operated by the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which provide cookie-based opt-outs in respect to cross-context advertising.  (These opt-out solutions are generally cookie-based and specific to a particular browser, so if you switch browsers, or clear your cookies, you will generally need to refresh your opt-out.).  Finally, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, the providers we work with may recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws.\n\nIn addition, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, we will recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws.\n\\nFinally, although we do not obtain mobile device information, we work with business partners who may associate the personal information we provide to them with mobile ad identifiers.  You may opt-out of cross-context advertising or targeting performed by these companies through the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this type of opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). Also, you may visit  https://youradchoices.com/appchoices to download the AppChoices Tool to control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device and https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/ for more information and instructions on opting out on mobile devices.\n\nAccessing the Personal Information We Have About You\n\\nIn certain states you may have a right to “access” or “know” about the specific information we hold about you, such as to deliver our Services.   If you would like to request access of your personal information, you may do so by contacting us at 888-993-2285 ext 4 or you may visit our “Data Access Request” page at https://webbula.com/ca-eu-data-request/.\n\nFor security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.\n\nAuthorized Agents\n\\nIf you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of Webbula’s use of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so as outlined on the following page: https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/\n\nSensitive Data\n\nSome states, like Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia, provide their residents (upon the applicable effective dates), the right to opt-in to the processing of their sensitive personal information or personal data. To the extent you believe you may have opted in to the collection of such personal information/data, you can opt out at any time so by providing your email here https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/\nSome states, like California and Utah, provide their residents (upon the applicable effective dates), have the right to opt-out of certain uses of their sensitive personal data. You can do so by providing your email here https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/\nIn some cases, you may appeal a decision made relating to your rights. Please contact us at privacy@webbula.com if you would like to inquire about an appeal.\n\nNevada Residents\n\nCertain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “covered information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.  Please contact us at privacy@webbula.com if you would like to opt out.\n\n \n\\nEU-US PRIVACY SHIELD\nPrivacy Shield Certification. As a business subject to the enforcement and investigatory powers of the Federal Trade Commission, Webbula, Inc. has certified our compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework with respect to the personal client data we receive from the relevant European countries, and the United Kingdom, effective as of the date our certification is posted at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list. You can learn more about the Privacy Shield program at https://www.privacyshield.gov. We may alternatively process personal data our clients in the EU submit via other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. (As to any third-party service providers we may use to process information subject to the Privacy Shield, we may have liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.)\n\nAccessing Your Data: European and UK residents may have certain legal rights to access certain personal data and to obtain its correction, amendment, or deletion. You may contact us at the contact information below to request access, correction, amendment, or deletion. Because our personnel have limited rights to identify and access an individual user’s personal data that our client has submitted to us, and because we process that data on behalf of our clients, we may first refer you to the client who submitted your data, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request.\n\nResolution of Complaints. In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, Webbula commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. If you have any concerns or complaints, please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Notice, and we will work with you to resolve your issue. Webbula has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to ANA, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit  ANA at EU US or Swiss Privacy Shield for Consumers – Data Compliance for more information or to file a complaint. The services of ANA are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact ANA at:\n\\nANA\nAttn: Privacy Shield\n225 Reinekers Lane, Suite 325\nAlexandria, VA 22314\n\n",
