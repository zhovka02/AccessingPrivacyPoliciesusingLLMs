We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.\\n\\nFor instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Section 5.E. Personal Information Sales Opt-Out Rights.\\n\\n     D. Response Timing and Format\\n\\nWe will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days.
