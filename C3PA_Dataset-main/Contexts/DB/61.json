We are committed to using state of-the-art technology in order to protect personal financial information entered on this website.

Information from cookies and other tracking technologies: Like many websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our site and collect information. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of our site may not function properly. Information from service providers: Information is collected from third-party service providers about geographical demographics, such as median household income or age. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is non-personally identifiable. How We Categorize Information: The types of information we collect fits into two categories in our data policy: Non-Identifiable : This is information about you or your household that doesn’t identify you personally such as cookie data, state of residence, etc. Personally Identifiable : This is information that identifies you directly: Confidential Data is basic information that identifies you personally, such as your full name, street address, email address or phone number How We Use Information: We use the information we collect from you and third parties to operate our Products, communicate with you, conduct research and development to improve or enhance our Products, services and customer experience. These are a few examples: To create your account with our partners whose services you have requested. We require you to enter data which is used to verify your identity, avoid fraud and ultimately sign you up for the partner offer you are requesting. In order to sign up for a partner’s offer, you will need to complete the partner’s sign-up form and authentication questions. To improve our recommendations and insights. The information we collect also helps us tailor our content and improve the way we match you to recommended offers or insights. We’re constantly working on ways to better identify and present the information that’s most relevant to you. To communicate with you. We use the information we collect to provide you with member support or to send you personalized offer recommendations. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed from e-mail promotion lists at any time. To make this request, please email admin@smacomm.com or unsubscribe HERE To conduct research and to improve and promote our services. We use the information we collect to conduct research and to improve or enhance and promote our Services. For legal reasons. To the extent permitted by law, we may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of, our employees, partners, and users. We reserve the right to share information with anyone outside of our network if we are mandated to do so by law or court order. Who Has Access to Information: The following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business: Advertisers We may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may aggregate location information and disclose it to advertisers to inform them of where their ads are performing. External Service Providers (i.e. Partner’s Offering Services to Customers) There are a number of separate offers from our partners that we refer to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of our site. If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their individual privacy policies. With your consent, we may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience, for example, notification services that provide push notifications directly to your mobile device(s). To prevent disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. Internal Service Providers We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of our business, products and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we  provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. In the Event of a Sale Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a “Transfer”) involving us and/or our affiliates. We specifically reserve the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from us and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of smacomm.com to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.smacomm.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. Network Advertising smacomm.com may use third-party advertising companies for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you. Using third-party advertising companies helps us and third-party advertisers better determine which advertisements or content to serve to you. For example, the third-party advertisers may use information regarding your visits to www.smacomm.com and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services, that third party advertisers believe will be of interest to you. The types of information that may be collected by third-party advertising companies include the following: the type of Internet browser you use; the type of computer operating system you use; the domain name of a website you visit, as well as information related to websites and Web pages you are viewing when an advertisement is requested; whether or not you visit specific pages of www.smacomm.com or other websites; the approximate physical location of your Internet service provider’s point of presence; the date and time of a visit to a website; search keywords passed from another server; the number of times you have clicked on an advertisement; and other interactions between you and a website. Controlling your Personal Information You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways: Do not fill out the forms : Filling out all forms is entirely optional and only required in order to verify your identity to sign you up for the offer or subscription you are interested in.
