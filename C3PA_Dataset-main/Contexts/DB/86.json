The CCPA And Personal Information. The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), effective January 1, 2020, as clarified by the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations approved on August 14, 2020, grants privacy rights to California consumers in connection with their Personal Information. “Personal Information” or “PI” is “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” PI does not include information lawfully made available from government records or information that is already subject to sector-specific privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), federal laws that impose requirements and restrictions to protect consumer data. A consumer has rights regarding his/her PI, including: A right to know what PI is collected, used, shared or sold by the business; A right to access PI collected and retained by the business; A right to require businesses and, by extension, their service providers, to delete PI, subject to certain exceptions; A right to opt-out of the business’ sale of PI; and A right to non-discrimination in terms of pricing or service for choosing to exercise a privacy right under the CCPA. Consumer Right To A Notice of Collection. A business that collects PI directly from a consumer must, at or before the point of collection, inform the consumer as to the categories to be collected and the purposes for which it shall be used. A business that intends to sell the PI must also notify the consumer and provide the website form for submitting a “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information ” request. Data brokers registered in California need not provide such a notice if their registration includes a link to instructions for opting-out. Consumer Right To Know. A covered business must disclose in its privacy policy the PI it has collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose in the past 12 months. A business must disclose the following in response to a verifiable request to know: The categories of PI the business has collected about the consumer; The categories of sources from which that PI was collected; The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling PI; The categories of third parties with whom the business shares PI; The categories of PI the business sold and categories of third parties to whom it was sold; The categories of PI the business disclosed for a business purpose and associated categories of third parties to whom those categories were disclosed; and If requested, the specific pieces of PI the business has collected. Consumer Right To Delete. A California consumer has the right to request that a covered business delete his/her PI, subject to certain exceptions. Once a request is reasonably verified by the business, the PI requested to be deleted must be erased from the records held by that business or otherwise deidentified or aggregated, and the business must direct its Service Providers with whom the information was shared to also delete the information, unless it is subject to an exception. A request to delete may be denied if the requestor’s identity cannot be verified or if retaining the information is necessary to: Complete the transaction for which it collected the PI, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, take action reasonably anticipated within the context of the ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract with the consumer. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.). Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on the consumer’s relationship with the business. Comply with a legal obligation. Make other internal and lawful uses of the information that are compatible with the context in which the consumer provided it. If a business stores PI on archived or backup systems, it may delay compliance with a request to delete for that data until the archived or backup system relating to that data is restored to an active system or next accessed or used for a sale, disclosure, or other commercial purpose. Consumer Right To Non-Discrimination. A business must not discriminate against a consumer who exercises CCPA rights. A business may charge different prices or provide a different quality of goods or services, but only if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the consumer by the consumer’s data. A business may offer financial incentives to a consumer for the collection, sale, or deletion of personal information on a prior, opt-in consent basis. Consumer Right To Opt-Out. A business that sells PI to third parties must provide notice to consumers, clearly inform them of the right to opt-out of the sale, and provide a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link on its website that enables the consumer to opt-out of future sales of that Consumer’s PI. A business is prohibited from selling the PI of a consumer the business knows is less than 16 years of age, unless (for a consumer between 13 and 16 years of age) the consumer has affirmatively authorized the sale or (for a consumer less than 13 years of age) the consumer’s parent or guardian has affirmatively authorized the sale. Privacy Policy Requirements. A business must include the following in its privacy policy, to be updated every 12 months: A description of consumer CCPA rights, including the right to opt out of the sale of PI and a separate link to a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” internet webpage if the business sells PI; The method(s) by which a CCPA request can be submitted; A list of the categories of PI the business has collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months; and For any business that, alone or in combination, buys, receives or shares for commercial purposes, or sells, the PI of 10 million or more consumers in a calendar year, the following metrics: The number of requests to know, delete, and opt-out received, complied with in whole or in part, and denied for the previous calendar year, and the median or mean number of days within which the business substantively responded to requests to know, delete, and opt-out. How Do I Submit a CCPA Request to Know or Request to Delete to the Company? Instructions: Requests To Know or Delete If you are a California resident and wish to submit a CCPA Request to Know or Request to Delete, you may use one of the following methods: Fill out the “ Request to Know or Delete Personal Information ” form. OR Call us, Toll-Free, at: 877-815-2268 Please be advised that we are only required to respond to your request to know or access twice in any 12-month period. Verification: Requests to Know or Delete We need to be reasonably sure that the person making a request to know or delete your PI is you, or a representative that you have authorized to make a request on your behalf. We cannot comply with your request if we cannot verify your identity or your authority to make a request for another person. Accordingly, before we can comply with a request to know or delete, you must provide information such as your full name, mailing address, and the last four digits of your social security number, so that we can to attempt to verify your identity and locate your records, if any. To the extent possible, we will not ask you for new information to verify your identity, but instead will request information that we can cross-check against existing records. If we are unable to verify your request without new information, we will delete the new information as soon as practical after processing your CCPA request, except as may be required to comply with the CCPA’s record retention requirements. We will never require you to create an account with us in order to verify your request. We will only use information you provide to us during the verification process to try to verify your identity or your authority to make the request for another person. Requests to know the specific pieces of information we may hold, and not just a list of the categories of information, require heightened verification procedures, and we will require you to submit a written declaration under penalty of perjury stating that you are the consumer whose PI is the subject of the request. In addition, certain pieces of information, such as a social security number, driver’s license number, government-issued identification number, financial account number, or health insurance or medical identification number, will not be disclosed in response to a CCPA request. If you wish to authorize someone else to act on your behalf in connection with your CCPA rights, we must receive proof that this person is authorized to do so. Proof can be provided by a consumer verifying his/her own identity directly with us and then providing written authority for a designated person to act on the consumer’s behalf, or through receipt of a power of attorney or other legal documentation of authority, or proof of registration with the California Secretary of State as a designated representative. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of a minor child, which requires that you submit proof of your status as a parent or legal guardian. Our Response: Requests to Know or Delete Within 10 business days of receiving a request to know or delete, we will provide confirmation of your request and an associated reference number. This may be provided by letter, email, or at the conclusion of a web form submission or phone call during which you submit a request. If you submit a Request to Delete, we may require you to re-confirm your choice to delete the information after verifying your request, but prior to any actual deletion that may be required. The Company strives to respond within 45 days of receiving a request to know or delete. If we need additional time, or cannot verify your request, we will let you know. We will respond by U.S. mail or email, at your option. Any information we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding receipt of your request. If we cannot respond to or comply with your request to know or delete, or we otherwise deny your request, we will explain our reasoning and decision in our response. We may, for example, deny a request to know or delete if: (1) it cannot be acted upon because the PI that we collected or maintain is solely in our role as a Service Provider, as that term is defined in the CCPA, (2) we cannot verify your identity, (3) we need to retain the information you seek to have deleted in order to complete the transaction for which it was collected, or (4) the information we maintain for you is exempt from the CCPA, such as information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ), or the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). We are required to keep a record of any CCPA request you submit for at least 24 months, including any assigned reference number, the request date and nature of the request, the manner in which the request was made, the date and nature of our response, the basis for any full or partial denial, and copies of any signed declarations submitted for verification purposes. We do not charge a fee to process a request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, and we have informed you in writing of the reasoning behind a charge and its estimated cost. We will provide a cost estimate before completing your request if we determine that a charge is warranted. NOTICE OF RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION California residents have the right to opt-out of the future sale of their PI by Company to Third Parties, with certain exceptions provided in the CCPA. Instructions: Requests to Opt-Out If you are a California resident and wish to opt-out of the future sale of your PI, you may use one of the following methods: Submit an Opt-Out Form on our Website by Clicking this Link: “ Do Not Sell My Personal Information ” Call us, Toll-Free, at: 877-815-2268 Verification: Requests to Opt-Out A request to opt-out need not be a verifiable consumer request. However, a request needs to include information sufficient to identify the PI that is subject to the request. Any information the Company requires for an opt-out request will be used for that purpose only. If you wish to authorize someone else to make a request to opt-out on your behalf, you must provide that person written permission signed by you. We may deny a request from your authorized agent if they cannot provide us with a signed authorization from you. Our Response: Requests to Opt-Out We comply with requests to opt-out as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 business days from the date we receive a request. If we sell PI subject to a request to opt-out after a request is received, but before we can process and comply with the request, we will notify the third parties that received the PI and direct them not to sell it. We will respond to your request by U.S. mail or email, at your option. There are certain exceptions to the right to opt-out. For example, a business may need to sell PI to comply with legal obligations or exercise legal claims or rights, or the PI may be exempt from the CCPA, such as information lawfully made available from government records or information collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ), or the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). In addition, if the Company has a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that a request to opt-out is fraudulent, we may deny a request to opt-out and will provide an explanation why we believe the request is fraudulent.
