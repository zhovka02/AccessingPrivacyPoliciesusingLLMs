This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your Personal Data (defined below) on those web sites of Moody’s that post or link directly to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”) and through offline means, how we use, disclose, and protect such data, and the choices you have concerning our use of such data. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Moody’s may from time to time update this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post or link to the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Any significant changes to the way we collect or use Personal Data will be highlighted on the homepage of the Site in advance. Please review the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to determine when this Privacy Policy was most recently revised. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Moody’s”, “we”, “us”, and “our” means Acquire Media U.S., LLC and Acquire Media 1 UK Limited. In some circumstances, you may have the option to decline to provide us with any Personal Data to visit the Site. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to visit all sections or use all features of the Site. This Privacy Policy shall also apply to any Moody’s mobile application and other forms of Moody’s online activity that reference this Privacy Policy. In such instances, the term “Site” shall include the applicable mobile application or other Moody’s online activity whenever that term is used herein. Types of Data Collected We gather Personal Data and Other Data (as described below). Collection of Personal Data Personal data is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, e.g., your name, email address, address, or phone number (“Personal Data”). We may need to collect and process Personal Data in order to provide requested information, products or services to you (including the Site) or because we are legally required to do so and/or we have a legitimate interest to do so. • Moody’s requests Personal Data from you if the Site requires registration. The registration process requests that you provide Personal Data, such as your name, business email address, business address or country/jurisdiction location, business phone number, and company affiliation, and agree to the User Agreement presented at the time of registration. • Moody’s may receive Personal Data from social media platforms. For example, if you elect to use your social media credentials to log-in to your Site account, certain Personal Data from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Data that is part of your social media profile. • Moody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, online chats, phone calls, and through other means. • Moody’s may request Personal Data from our customers to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and other applicable laws. • On some of Moody’s Sites you are able to maintain “portfolios,” where, if you are a registered user, you have the option to list financial instruments in which you have a special interest. To be useful, this information must be stored on the Site, and is accessible to anyone with whom you share your username and password. For this reason, please safeguard your username and password carefully and do not disclose them to any other person. • We may use third-party payment services (each, a “Payment Service”) to collect payments made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a webpage that is hosted by a Payment Service (or a Payment Service’s service providers) and not by Moody’s. Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by the Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, a Payment Service’s use of information collected through a Payment Service page. • Moody’s collects information through various other means, including searches online, participation at conferences and events, individual introductions, from employers that enroll their employees in our services or provide services to us, and from selected third-party business partners. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services. • We collect name and professional contacts details of employees of our service providers, either directly from those third-party employees or from their employers. • Products. Our news products and services may contain limited Personal Data about executives, officers, managers, investors, and individual shareholders of organizations mentioned in news stories. We source this Personal Data directly and indirectly (via information providers) from public records (such as SEC filings), corporate disclosures and press releases, publicly available websites, newsfeeds, newspapers and magazines. Use of Personal Data Collected We use Personal Data transparently and in compliance with applicable law for legitimate business purposes, including the following: • Fulfillment of Requests. Moody’s may use Personal Data about you to deliver products and services to you, and to provide you with information about products and services you’ve ordered. We will engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you and to fulfil our contractual obligations. • Marketing Communications. From time to time, in compliance with applicable laws, we may use Personal Data about you to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If your employer is a Moody’s customer, we may also inform you of such products, programs, services and promotions using Personal Data about you that your employer provided to Moody’s. We may also use Personal Data of media contacts for press release distribution or sharing other newsworthy developments related to our business activities. If you would prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the “ Your Choices ” section below. • Promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, “Promotions”). If you choose to enter Moody’s Promotions, we may require certain Personal Data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about our use of Personal Data about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Data conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control. We will use this information to operate the Promotions. • Other Business Purposes. We may also use Personal Data about you for other business purposes, such as data analysis (for example, to improve the efficiency of our services), editorial and feedback purposes, providing customer support, customizing and improving the content and layout of the Site, completing business transactions (for example, to confirm content requested is received by customers), development and delivery of marketing and promotion plans and materials, statistical analysis of user behavior (for example, to understand what parts of the Site are of most interest to users), product development, conducting surveys, receipt of services from you or your employer, and market research, and administering individual accounts. • Administrative Communications. Moody’s reserves the right to use Personal Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, products, services, your account status, the User Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Site, products and/or services. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, products and/or services, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications. We will engage in this activity to manage our contractual relationship with you and/or to comply with a legal obligation. • Compliance with law and regulation. We may use Personal Data as necessary to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements such as sales tax collection, audits, etc. • Moody’s uses Personal Data for purposes compatible with those notified in this Privacy Policy and any other online or offline applicable privacy notice, and in accordance with applicable law.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect your Personal Data (defined below) on those web sites of Moody’s that post or link directly to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”) and through offline means, how we use, disclose, and protect such data, and the choices you have concerning our use of such data.} "

We may need to collect and process Personal Data in order to provide requested information, products or services to you (including the Site) or because we are legally required to do so and/or we have a legitimate interest to do so.\\n• Moody’s requests Personal Data from you if the Site requires registration. The registration process requests that you provide Personal Data, such as your name, business email address, business address or country/jurisdiction location, business phone number, and company affiliation, and agree to the User Agreement presented at the time of registration.\\n• Moody’s may receive Personal Data from social media platforms. For example, if you elect to use your social media credentials to log-in to your Site account, certain Personal Data from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Data that is part of your social media profile.\\n• Moody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, online chats, phone calls, and through other means.\\n• Moody’s may request Personal Data from our customers to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and other applicable laws.\\n• On some of Moody’s Sites you are able to maintain “portfolios,” where, if you are a registered user, you have the option to list financial instruments in which you have a special interest. To be useful, this information must be stored on the Site, and is accessible to anyone with whom you share your username and password. For this reason, please safeguard your username and password carefully and do not disclose them to any other person.\\n• We may use third-party payment services (each, a “Payment Service”) to collect payments made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you may be directed to a webpage that is hosted by a Payment Service (or a Payment Service’s service providers) and not by Moody’s. Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by the Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, a Payment Service’s use of information collected through a Payment Service page.\\n• Moody’s collects information through various other means, including searches online, participation at conferences and events, individual introductions, from employers that enroll their employees in our services or provide services to us, and from selected third-party business partners. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services.\\n• We collect name and professional contacts details of employees of our service providers, either directly from those third-party employees or from their employers.\\n• Products. Our news products and services may contain limited Personal Data about executives, officers, managers, investors, and individual shareholders of organizations mentioned in news stories. We source this Personal Data directly and indirectly (via information providers) from public records (such as SEC filings), corporate disclosures and press releases, publicly available websites, newsfeeds, newspapers and magazines.",

If you would prefer that we not send electronic marketing messages to you, please see the “Your Choices” section below.\\n• Promotions. We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, “Promotions”). If you choose to enter Moody’s Promotions, we may require certain Personal Data when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion.

Moody’s reserves the right to use Personal Data to send to you important information regarding the Site, products, services, your account status, the User Agreement, this Privacy Policy, or any other policies, agreements or transactions relevant to your use of the Site, products and/or services.

In compliance with applicable laws, Moody’s may transfer Personal Data among our affiliates (a list of which is available at http://www.moodys.com/Affiliates_of_Moodys) to allow our affiliates to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you, and such affiliates may otherwise use your Personal Data in accordance with the privacy policy applicable to them as specified in the affiliates list referenced above in this bullet. If you would prefer not to receive marketing communications from Moody’s or our affiliates, please see the “Your Choices” section below. Moody’s Corporation will be the party responsible for jointly used Personal Data.\\n\\n• Strategic Partners and Co-Branded Sites. From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Moody’s to provide or promote joint products, services, applications, or features (together, “Jointly Offered Items”). These special relationships may include co-branded web sites (“co-branded pages”). Any information, including Personal Data, that you provide in connection with one of these Jointly Offered Items, and/or on one of these co-branded pages, will be shared with our third-party partners. You should check these third parties’ web sites for information regarding their privacy practices. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES. If you do not want Personal Data about you shared with such third parties, please do not provide Personal Data in connection with the Jointly Offered Items and/or co-branded pages.\\n\\n• Third-Party Data Providers. If you subscribe to a Moody’s product or service that contains third-party data, we may be required to provide your Personal Data to the third party as part of our reporting obligations. We will only do so if a third-party data provider conditions your receipt of their data on knowing your identity.\\n\\n• Conferences and Events. When you attend a conference or event organized by Moody’s, your name and contact information may be shared with other attendees and co-hosts of the conference or event.\\n\\n• Promotions. We may share the Personal Data you provide in connection with Promotions with third-party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to those Promotions.\\n\\n• Assignment. We may disclose or transfer any and all Personal Data that we collect to an affiliated entity or a third party (and their respective advisors) in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).\\n\\n• Law Enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance. We may use and disclose Personal Data about you to others as we believe to be appropriate: (a) in compliance with laws, rules, or regulations in any country in which Moody’s operates, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from government or public authorities, including government and public authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our Terms of Use; (e) to protect our operations or those of any affiliated entities; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Moody’s, its affiliated entities, you, or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. For example, we may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose Personal Data about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities. Where we receive requests for Personal Data from domestic or foreign government or public authorities, we will resist, narrow or challenge such requests as appropriate and to the extent permitted by applicable law.",
