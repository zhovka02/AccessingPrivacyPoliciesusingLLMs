Please see below under the header “Processing Your Requests” for information about the personal information collected in connection with consumer requests submitted to us under CCPA. Disclosure of Personal Information With regard to Collected Data, Customer Data, and Segment Data, we disclose (and during the last 12 months have disclosed) each of the above categories of personal information solely as directed by the applicable Customer. With regard to Licensed Data, for purposes of the CCPA: “ Sales ”: (i) we “sell” (as defined by CCPA) each of the above categories of personal information to our advertiser and agency Customers in connection with their (and, in the case of agency Customers, their respective customers’) marketing and advertising activities, and (ii) we sell (and have sold during the 12 months prior to the “Last Modified” date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy) each of the above categories of personal information third-party data brokers that may further sell such personal information to their customers in connection with such customers’ marketing and advertising activities; however, we do not knowingly sell the personal information of California consumers under the age of 16 without required affirmative authorization; and “Disclosures for a Business Purpose” : we disclose (and have disclosed during the 12 months prior to the “Last Modified” date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy) each of the above categories of personal information for a “business purpose” (as defined by CCPA) to service providers that perform certain services on our behalf, such as hosting service providers, data analytics providers, advertising and marketing service providers, technology consultants, and consumer information verification providers. Methods of Submitting Requests If you are a California consumer, you may submit requests to exercise your “Right to Know” or your “Right to Delete” via any of the following methods: By web form , available by clicking the following link: CCPA Request Web Form By email , to: CCPAPrivacy@VideoAmp.com By toll-free telephone , to: 1 (844) 954-1754 Processing Your Requests The process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form  (where we also collect additional information about the requestor’s TV viewing and household as part of our verification process for such requests).  Therefore, if you submit such a request via either the telephone number listed above or the email address listed above, it will require more time and at least one more step than if you were to submit your request via web form. We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request and submit the additional information described above. Please note that the process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA also requires a service provider to recognize or place its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it collects during performance of this service (which collected information consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with this process.  We use the information that we collect to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs) and Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as TV viewing information)) only in connection with such purposes and for security and/or fraud-prevention purposes. Please note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to verify or process your “Right to Know” request or your “Right to Delete” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request with the Licensed Data we have collected about you. If you are a California consumer, you have the right, at any time, to direct us not to sell your personal information; you may exercise such “Right to Opt Out” under CCPA by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link below, which takes you to the web form listed above, or via any of the other methods described above: DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION The process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form. Therefore, if you submit such a request via either the telephone number or the email address listed above, it will require more time and at least one more step than if you were to submit your request via the web form. We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request. Please note that the process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA also entails a service provider recognizing or placing its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it so collects (which consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with our CCPA request processes.  We use the information we collect to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs)) only in connection with such purpose. Please note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to process your “Right to Opt Out” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request to opt-out under CCPA with your Licensed Data. However, as (i) Licensed Data originates from TV viewing information and (ii) we receive Licensed Data from data licensors (who may be considered “data brokers” under California law) that have contractually agreed to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, we believe that you should also be able to exercise CCPA rights, including the right to opt out under CCPA (i.e., to elect “Do Not Sell”), with respect to your personal information through your smart TV(s), MVPD device(s), and/or OTT box/device(s). Authorized Agents If you are a California consumer, you may use an “authorized agent” (as defined by CCPA) to submit a “Request to Know”, a “Request to Delete”, and/or a “Request to Opt-Out” under CCPA on your behalf.  Your authorized agent will need to provide us with a copy of a written permission that is signed by you and indicates that you have provided such authorization.  Also, as both (i) the process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA and (ii) the process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA require (a) us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser) and (b) the requestor to visit our web form, your authorized agent will also need to use your device in connection with any such CCPA request. Recordkeeping Information VideoAmp will maintain records of consumer requests made pursuant to CCPA and how we responded to those requests in accordance with CCPA.

your “Right to Know” or your “Right to Delete” via any of the following methods:\\n\\nBy web form, available by clicking the following link: CCPA Request Web Form\\nBy email, to: CCPAPrivacy@VideoAmp.com\\nBy toll-free telephone, to: 1 (844) 954-1754\\nProcessing Your Requests\\nThe process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form  (where we also collect additional information about the requestor’s TV viewing and household as part of our verification process for such requests).  Therefore, if you submit such a request via either the telephone number listed above or the email address listed above, it will require more time and at least one more step than if you were to submit your request via web form. We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request and submit the additional information described above. \\n\\nPlease note that the process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA also requires a service provider to recognize or place its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it collects during performance of this service (which collected information consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with this process.  We use the information that we collect to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs) and Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as TV viewing information)) only in connection with such purposes and for security and/or fraud-prevention purposes.\\n\\nPlease note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to verify or process your “Right to Know” request or your “Right to Delete” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request with the Licensed Data we have collected about you. \\n\\nIf you are a California consumer, you have the right, at any time, to direct us not to sell your personal information; you may exercise such “Right to Opt Out” under CCPA by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link below, which takes you to the web form listed above, or via any of the other methods described above:\\n\\n\\nDO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION\\n\\nThe process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form.

We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request. Please note that the process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA also entails a service provider recognizing or placing its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it so collects (which consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with our CCPA request processes.  We use the information we collect to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs)) only in connection with such purpose.\\n\\nPlease note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to process your “Right to Opt Out” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request to opt-out under CCPA with your Licensed Data.
