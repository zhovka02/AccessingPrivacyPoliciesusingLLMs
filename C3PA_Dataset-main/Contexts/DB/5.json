Right to Know (i.e., Information About and Access to Your Personal Information) You have the right to request that we disclose personal information we collected about you pursuant to Civil Code sections 1798.100, 1798.110, or 1798.115 including any or all of the following: Specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you; Categories of personal information we collected about you; Categories of sources from which your personal information is collected; Categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you; Categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.

The CCPA also requires that if requested, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one (1) entity to another without hindrance. Right to Delete The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.  However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons: if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected; to comply with a legal obligation; to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et seq .), as amended; to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Verifiable Consumer Requests The CCPA considers the right to know and the right to delete as verifiable consumer requests.  Verifiable consumer requests must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are in fact the California resident or Household about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We may deny a request to know or a request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request or confirm that the requested personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information that you provide us to verify your identity or authority. How to Submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete Submit your request using the information in Section 7 (Contact Information) above and include the value of your tribalfusion.com ANON_ID cookie (“TF ANON_ID Cookie Value” or “Cookie Value”) as explained below. Verifying Your Identity with Your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value Your Cookie Value is the only repository where consumer identifying information may be stored.  To find your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value (highlighted blue in example below): Open your web browser and go to “tribalfusion.com”; Locate the ANON_ID cookie (see image below) in your browser’s privacy or cookie settings (location will vary by browser); and Copy the TF ANON_ID Cookie Value and email it to privacy@VDX.tv . Your Cookie Value is the only repository where consumer identifying information may be stored.  To find your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value (highlighted blue in example below): Our Confirmation of or Response to Your Request to Know or Request to Delete The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.  However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons: permanently and completely erasing your personal information on our existing systems (except archived or back-up systems); deidentifying your personal information; or aggregating your personal information. If we deny your request, we will (unless otherwise prohibited by law): describe the basis for the denial, including any conflict with federal or state law, or CCPA exception; delete any personal information that is not subject to the exception (if any); and will not use your personal information retained for any other purpose than provided for by the CCPA exception. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request.  However, we will inform you that your identity cannot be verified. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Information Under the CCPA, you may Opt-Out of the sale of your personal information from a business to third parties. While we do not sell your personal information suppression of any sharing of your personal information can be applied by following the same steps laid out in the Right to Delete above. Rights for Minors Our Site and services are not intended for children.  We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or sell the personal information of children under the age of sixteen (16). Right to Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.  We will not: Deny you services; Charge you different prices or rates for services by granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; Provide you a different level or quality of services; or Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services. Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights Only you, a valid power of attorney under the California Probate Code, as amended, or a natural person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete related to your information. If you wish to submit a request to know or a request to delete via an Authorized Agent, your Authorized Agent must provide us with written and signed permission from you to submit the request(s).  “Signed” means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically per the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.7 et seq. Next, contact us (as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above) so we may verify your identity and confirm that you provided the requesting Authorized Agent permission to submit the request(s). Fees We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.  If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request. Shine The Light Law Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.  If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above. Do Not Track California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. Disclosure of Consumer Requests As required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), VDX.tv handled the following types of consumer requests during the year 2020: Type of Request Received Fulfilled Denied Average Response Time Subject Access 25 25 0 8 days Data Removal 48 48 0 5 days Opt-Out/Delete 63 62 0 10 days Note, these are global numbers, not only from California residents. In terms of the data we use, “Opt-Out” is the same as “delete”. “Data Removal” in the table above means that if we receive a request regarding data on one of our partner publisher websites, over which we have no editorial control, we will forward the request to the partner publisher for further action. European Privacy Rights This Section 10 applies to European Residents only.  A “European Resident” is a resident of a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR describes situations in which companies are permitted to collect or reuse your personal information.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement, we will specify the legal requirement and the information we require.  If we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), our legitimate interests will generally involve operating and improving this Site, communicating with you, marketing purposes, or detecting or preventing fraud.  For more information about GDPR, please visit the EU’s “Data protection and online privacy” page .  If you have questions about our compliance with GDPR, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.

The CCPA also requires that if requested, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one (1) entity to another without hindrance. Right to Delete The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.  However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons: if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected; to comply with a legal obligation; to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et seq .), as amended; to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Verifiable Consumer Requests The CCPA considers the right to know and the right to delete as verifiable consumer requests.  Verifiable consumer requests must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are in fact the California resident or Household about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We may deny a request to know or a request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request or confirm that the requested personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information that you provide us to verify your identity or authority. How to Submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete Submit your request using the information in Section 7 (Contact Information) above and include the value of your tribalfusion.com ANON_ID cookie (“TF ANON_ID Cookie Value” or “Cookie Value”) as explained below.

If we deny your request, we will (unless otherwise prohibited by law): describe the basis for the denial, including any conflict with federal or state law, or CCPA exception; delete any personal information that is not subject to the exception (if any); and will not use your personal information retained for any other purpose than provided for by the CCPA exception. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request.  However, we will inform you that your identity cannot be verified. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Information Under the CCPA, you may opt-out of the sale of your personal information from a business to third parties. While we do not sell your personal information suppression of any sharing of your personal information can be applied by following the same steps laid out in the Right to Delete above. Rights for Minors Our Site and services are not intended for children.  We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or sell the personal information of children under the age of sixteen (16). Right to Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.  We will not: Deny you services; Charge you different prices or rates for services by granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; Provide you a different level or quality of services; or Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services. Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights Only you, a valid power of attorney under the California Probate Code, as amended, or a natural person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete related to your information. If you wish to submit a request to know or a request to delete via an Authorized Agent, your Authorized Agent must provide us with written and signed permission from you to submit the request(s).  “Signed” means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically per the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.7 et seq. Next, contact us (as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above) so we may verify your identity and confirm that you provided the requesting Authorized Agent permission to submit the request(s). Fees We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.  If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request. Shine The Light Law Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.  If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above. Do Not Track California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

Adding Publishers into the Network 1.1 Adding Publishers into the network Strict policies are in place to ensure that only high-quality sites are selected for VDX.tv’s network. Adding publishers evolves from a two-step process: Site Acceptance: Publishers must meet the VDX.tv Publisher Code of Conduct before being accepted Manual quality checks are performed by VDX.tv employees to ensure compliance Sites are also constantly scanned by our proprietary PageGuard TM technology and are removed if questionable content is found Transparent site lists are always made available for advertisers to approve or remove sites that are not an appropriate match for their brand Domain Verification: Before a new site goes live, they must identify all domains that they will/might run an VDX.tv ad on After the publisher submits the domain(s), VDX.tv employees manually vet the domain for brand-safety purposes If the domain is approved, it is added into the ‘approved domain’ list. VDX.tv’s ad server references this approved list to learn where it is and is not allowed, to serve an impression If a non-approved domain calls our ad server for an ad, the ad server rejects the request and will NOT serve that domain an ad This process and proprietary technology prevents publishers from accidentally or intentionally retrafficking our ads to questionable sites 1.2 Publisher Code of Conduct Overview The VDX.tv Publisher Code of Conduct defines types of prohibited content (i.e. pornography, copyright infringement, spam, fraud, pyramid schemes, etc…) and types of prohibited actions (i.e. tag re-trafficking, altering ad creative, pay for clicks/impressions, timed rotations/auto-refresh, etc…) Publisher domains are approved at VDX.tv’s discretion (i.e. no publishers with downloadable software, no publishers that may be harmful to the business reputation of VDX.tv) 1.3 Inventory acquired through RTB We supplement our on-network activity with inventory acquired off-network. We typically use TAG-certified ( https://www.tagtoday.net/registry ) exchange partners, where feasible. We always run activity via a pre-vetted domain Accept list, unless otherwise agreed with the client. Our list of partners is available for review, although please note, this is subject to change. 1.4 Ads.txt We support ads.txt and have done so since its launch in 2017. We continue to work with publishers who have an ads.txt file enabled and enter us as an approved seller of their inventory. Any inventory acquired through RTB is also ads.txt compliant. We are committed to our role in creating a cleaner, more transparent advertising ecosystem for everyone. 2. Brand Safety The following section outlines the various roles that both proprietary and 3rd party technology plays in ensuring delivery to the audience intended by the agency/brand. 2.1 PageGuard™ PageGuard™ is VDX.tv’s proprietary answer to ensuring that all campaigns are delivered to safe environments. It uses a 3 step processes to provide a comprehensive and proactive solution to prevent the possibility of ads appearing on inappropriate content: Site acceptance (covered in section 1.1) Domain Verification (covered in section 1.1) Page Level Contextualization: Pages are scanned daily according to traffic priority. Our proprietary page-level contextualization technology then categorizes these pages, assessing the safety of the content. In the event a page is deemed to be an unsafe brand environment, VDX.tv will not serve an ad. 2.2 3rd Party Content Verification In addition to PageGuard, we can also layer on 3 rd party verification via one of our integrated partners , or via a vendor of the client’s choice. This works as follows: An agency/brand decides they want to run a 3rd party verification tool Agency either works directly with the verification provider to create verification specifications OR allows VDX.tv to pick a preferred vendor Agency sends the specifications to VDX.tv – specs might include an Accept/Block list, intended or violating website categorizations, violating keywords, intended geo targeting, etc… VDX.tv targets the campaign in our ad server per the agency’s specifications Campaign is set live after applying the verification code in either the agency’s ad server or VDX.tv’s ad server VDX.tv starts to receive reporting from the agency ad server AND the verification tool If no violations are seen, continue to run campaign If violations are seen, adjust campaign targeting until the violations go below the predetermined threshold or disappear altogether **Due to occasionally inaccurate categorizations by the 3rd party vendors, VDX.tv account managers are trained to vet the site categorization from the vendors against their own personal categorization. If the AM categorization vastly disagrees with the vendor’s categorization engine, the AM may pursue the agency to add the site to a whitelist OR the verification vendor to re-categorize the site. 2.3 Take Down Policy If violations are seen, we adjust the campaign targeting until the violations go below the predetermined threshold or disappear altogether. Correction of flagged violations will occur within 48 hours, but best endeavors will be made to rectify immediately. The contractual consequences of not responding appropriately to a takedown request in the specified time frame will be subject to the terms of individual IOs. 3. Geo Targeting We utilize the leading databases for effective geo-targeting. Please note that there may be minor discrepancies as a result of different vendors using different databases. 4. Malware VDX.tv uses The Media Trust as its 3rd party malware detection service. 4.1 Media Trust Integration We have an API integration with the Media Trust that allows them to programmatically scan our ad tags looking for malware. If malware is detected on a tag, this is immediately flagged for internal review and where necessary, the campaign paused and client notified. 5. Fraud VDX.tv has a number of safeguards in place to help keep our network clean and free of invalid traffic: PageGuard, click fraud algorithms, impression fraud algorithms, and a proprietary ad server that allows us to monitor and adjust accordingly. 5.1 Impression Fraud We do not serve any campaigns to robotic impressions For every impression, we compare the user agent with a list of known user agents and if found, we mark the request origination from a robot Apart from the above static list, we maintain a count of ads served to a user over a certain amount of time. If that gets too high, we flag the activity as potentially invalid and any subsequent impressions for the remaining browsing session will not be counted. That flag can be removed if the activity returns to normal behavior for a sufficient period of time. Bots are detected and blocked in the future both by means of built-in logic inside our ad server and offline processes. 5.2 Click Fraud The ad server first checks the combination of creative id (via the mediadata_id), user_id (the unique id associated with a cookie) and timestamp. If we’ve seen the combination before, disregard the click request (it’s a duplicate). The ad server has a strong algorithm to detect all duplicate clicks and disregard those duplicate requests. Next, check the IP address and user agent requesting the click against our list of known robots. If either is found, the click request will not be honored. If a user has clicked more than a certain number in a preset amount of time, it will be treated as ROBOT for all subsequent views/clicks Bots are detected and blocked in the future both by means of built-in logic inside our ad server and having offline processes. 5.3 Manual Monitoring We look for suspicious patterns in the data that may indicate bots or purchased traffic Pre-launch monitoring: Prior to approval, a domain is manually vetted using a combination of licensed tools and proprietary methodology to help determine the likelihood that the domain engages in nefarious behavior Post-launch monitoring: After domain approval and traffic starts flowing, pubs are monitored on certain distributions of inventory types, as well as fluctuations of various metrics Consultative technology monitoring: various services are leveraged as an additional safeguard VDX.tv’s dedicated publisher team manually monitors this publisher activity on an ongoing basis. If irregularities are noticed, we will either: Remove the publisher immediately, OR Start a conversation regarding the infraction(s). If the publisher is forthcoming with information, we will entertain a second chance. If not, they will be removed 6. Verified Services Used Please refer to our list of services that are leveraged by VDX.tv’s display network to guarantee accurate delivery of advertiser campaigns. Some of these services are used on request, while others are used at regular or consistent intervals. VDX.tv reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate these Safety Guidelines at any time and without advance notice. Continued access to or use of VDX.tv’s services after any such revision constitutes agreement to the revised Safety Guidelines. ‍ Last modified July 2022 Copyright © 2022 VDX.tv ‍ VDX.tv takes a zero-tolerance approach towards slavery and human trafficking within its supply chain and expects the same commitment from its suppliers, contractors, and business partners. This statement sets out the steps it has taken during the financial year to reflect this commitment. Organisational structure VDX.tv is an international video advertising effectiveness company. We employ over 500 people in a number of offices located across North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Our Supply Chains Our key supply chains comprise: Digital advertising marketplaces, exchanges, supply-side platforms and publishers; Other companies supplying services connected to the serving, monitoring and verification of on-line advertisements; Data suppliers; and Other IT and technical service companies. These businesses are predominantly staffed by highly-skilled employees. We consider that the sector that we operate in, the transactions that we undertake and any business relationships that we enter into all carry a negligible risk in terms of slavery and human trafficking. In light of the above, VDX.tv assesses that the overall risk from slavery and human trafficking within its business is negligible. Our Approach VDX.tv acts ethically and with integrity in all its business relationships. VDX.tv is committed to ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its supply chains or in any part of our business. We hire individuals directly via interview process, whether permanent staff or contractor. The vast majority of our employees are permanent staff. Due Diligence VDX.tv will not support or deal with any business knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking. VDX.tv will remain alert to any risk from slavery and human trafficking. If VDX.tv has any reason to suspect that any of its suppliers are affected by slavery or human trafficking, it will carry out reasonable and proportionate investigations and take whatever action it considers appropriate. Further Steps We will review the risk from slavery and human trafficking annually and assess whether the risk has increased. If the risk has increased, we will consider what further actions are required to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in any part of our business or supply chains. Such further actions may include adapting the supply chain and/or extending training about slavery and human trafficking more widely across employees.

Right to Know (i.e., Information About and Access to Your Personal Information) You have the right to request that we disclose personal information we collected about you pursuant to Civil Code sections 1798.100, 1798.110, or 1798.115 including any or all of the following: Specific pieces of personal information that we collected about you; Categories of personal information we collected about you; Categories of sources from which your personal information is collected; Categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you; Categories of third parties to whom your personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.

The CCPA also requires that if requested, we provide you with responsive materials in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit your information from one (1) entity to another without hindrance. Right to Delete The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.  However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons: if we need your information to complete the transaction for which it was collected; to comply with a legal obligation; to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et seq .), as amended; to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; to identify and repair errors that impair existing and intended functionality; or to make other internal and lawful uses of your information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Verifiable Consumer Requests The CCPA considers the right to know and the right to delete as verifiable consumer requests.  Verifiable consumer requests must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are in fact the California resident or Household about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We may deny a request to know or a request to delete if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request or confirm that the requested personal information relates to you. We will only use personal information that you provide us to verify your identity or authority. How to Submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete Submit your request using the information in Section 7 (Contact Information) above and include the value of your tribalfusion.com ANON_ID cookie (“TF ANON_ID Cookie Value” or “Cookie Value”) as explained below. Verifying Your Identity with Your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value Your Cookie Value is the only repository where consumer identifying information may be stored.  To find your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value (highlighted blue in example below): Open your web browser and go to “tribalfusion.com”; Locate the ANON_ID cookie (see image below) in your browser’s privacy or cookie settings (location will vary by browser); and Copy the TF ANON_ID Cookie Value and email it to privacy@VDX.tv . Your Cookie Value is the only repository where consumer identifying information may be stored.  To find your TF ANON_ID Cookie Value (highlighted blue in example below): Our Confirmation of or Response to Your Request to Know or Request to Delete The CCPA generally permits you to request that we and our direct service providers (i.e., Partners) delete personal information collected from you in accordance with Civil Code section 1798.105.  However, we are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons: permanently and completely erasing your personal information on our existing systems (except archived or back-up systems); deidentifying your personal information; or aggregating your personal information. If we deny your request, we will (unless otherwise prohibited by law): describe the basis for the denial, including any conflict with federal or state law, or CCPA exception; delete any personal information that is not subject to the exception (if any); and will not use your personal information retained for any other purpose than provided for by the CCPA exception. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request.  However, we will inform you that your identity cannot be verified. Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Information Under the CCPA, you may opt-out of the sale of your personal information from a business to third parties. While we do not sell your personal information suppression of any sharing of your personal information can be applied by following the same steps laid out in the Right to Delete above. Rights for Minors Our Site and services are not intended for children.  We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or sell the personal information of children under the age of sixteen (16). Right to Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.  We will not: Deny you services; Charge you different prices or rates for services by granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; Provide you a different level or quality of services; or Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for services or a different level or quality of services. Who May Exercise Your CCPA Rights Only you, a valid power of attorney under the California Probate Code, as amended, or a natural person or business entity registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California that you authorize to act on your behalf (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request to know or delete related to your information. If you wish to submit a request to know or a request to delete via an Authorized Agent, your Authorized Agent must provide us with written and signed permission from you to submit the request(s).  “Signed” means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically per the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.7 et seq. Next, contact us (as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above) so we may verify your identity and confirm that you provided the requesting Authorized Agent permission to submit the request(s). Fees We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.  If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request. Shine The Light Law Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.  If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above. Do Not Track California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  We do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. Disclosure of Consumer Requests As required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), VDX.tv handled the following types of consumer requests during the year 2020: Type of Request Received Fulfilled Denied Average Response Time Subject Access 25 25 0 8 days Data Removal 48 48 0 5 days Opt-out/Delete 63 62 0 10 days Note, these are global numbers, not only from California residents. In terms of the data we use, “opt-out” is the same as “delete”. “Data Removal” in the table above means that if we receive a request regarding data on one of our partner publisher websites, over which we have no editorial control, we will forward the request to the partner publisher for further action. European Privacy Rights This Section 10 applies to European Residents only.  A “European Resident” is a resident of a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR describes situations in which companies are permitted to collect or reuse your personal information. Our legal basis for collecting and using your information depends on the specific information at issue and the corresponding circumstances of collecting such information.  We collect your personal information only with your consent or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  We may also have legal obligations to collect your information or may otherwise need your information to protect your vital interests or those of another person. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement, we will specify the legal requirement and the information we require.  If we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), our legitimate interests will generally involve operating and improving this Site, communicating with you, marketing purposes, or detecting or preventing fraud.  For more information about GDPR, please visit the EU’s “Data protection and online privacy” page .  If you have questions about our compliance with GDPR, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.
