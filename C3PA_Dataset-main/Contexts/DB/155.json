Also, third-party apps and websites can use our measurement and advertising services to better understand usage of their services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertisements. The information we collect includes information about your use of those websites and apps, as well as information those apps or websites enable us to collect from their services. For example, a streaming video provider may enable us to receive information about the content you watch so that our recommendation service can suggest additional content that you might like. 1.3 Information We Collect from Other Sources Where the law permits, we may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, we might obtain information from data providers and advertising exchange services, including assumed demographics and interests, and data about your engagement with certain ads. We may also obtain from our data providers household or unique device identifiers (such as IP Addresses and Advertising IDs) gathered across platforms (including websites, TV applications, or mobile applications) which may be combined with our data and distributed to our clients so they can better tailor their advertising, marketing, measurement, analytics, and research; our data providers who are contractually bound to comply with all applicable data privacy laws before collecting such data and providing it to us.

Or, we may share data about your device with advertising platforms to help make the ads you see more relevant to you.

In the future Samba TV may also establish additional affiliates and subsidiaries in other countries.

For example, we may transfer your personal information to Samba’s servers in the U.S. The countries where we may transfer your personal information might have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective as the laws of your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information abroad, we will take appropriate safeguards to protect the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and seek to ensure that overseas recipients comply with applicable privacy laws. When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland, we ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects by placing obligations on the recipient of the data pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.

Security Samba TV takes reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction ‍ ‍ 7. Your Rights In general, you have the right to access, update or delete your personal information. This means you have the right to request that we: Inform you of the personal information we collect (and provide you with a copy of your personal information) and how we use it. Correct any errors in that information. Delete your personal information. Disclose to you what personal information of yours we have shared or sold to third parties.

This confirming information will only be used to process your request. ‍ ‍ 8. Your Choices Below are the choices we provide in connection with the practices described in this Policy. 8.1 Smart TV Services We require TV manufacturers to provide you with an opt-in to enable our Smart TV Services that collect Content Viewership Information. This opt-in will usually be presented when you first set up your Smart TV, or after your Smart TV gets a software update that includes our Smart TV Services. You should be able to opt in or out of our Smart TV Services at any time your TV is connected to the Internet. You typically can find a feature to opt-out and opt-in in the “settings” menu of your TV; it may also be in the settings menu of the application that integrates our Services. If you have trouble finding this feature, you should contact the TV manufacturer to determine the exact location. If you opt out of our Smart TV Services, we will no longer collect TV viewing information through this service. However, we still may receive Content Viewership Information, as described above in the “Collection of Information” section, when you watch content through certain Smart TV Apps. You should review the opt-out options provided by such applications. If you cannot find the opt-out settings, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv. You may also choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking from the Privacy menu within Smart TV Settings on your Smart TV. If you do so, our advertising platform will opt your Samba TV Advertising ID out of receiving targeted advertising based on Content Viewing Information from Smart TV Services, regardless of what device you are using. Note that whenever you want to unlink the data associated with your Samba TV Advertising ID, you can simply reset it. Please check with the TV manufacturer for the exact location of these features. If you cannot find them or your TV manufacturer has not enabled them, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv with your TV manufacturer and model number and we will attempt to provide you with more detailed instructions on where to locate these features. If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your Smart TV, you should perform a “factory reset.” This will 1) reset the Samba TV advertising ID, and 2) allow the new owner of the TV to choose whether they want to opt-in or opt-out. If you sell or give away your Smart TV without performing a “factory reset,” information about the new owner may be incorrectly attributed to you. You may also find helpful information about how to opt-out of Smart TV Services and television streaming devices at Network Advertising Initiative’s web page dedicated to “ Internet Connected TV Choices .” 8.2 Interest Based/Tailored Advertising You may learn more about “interest-based” or “tailored” advertising, as well as pertinent self-regulatory frameworks by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). The NAI and DAA are industry associations that develop policies around online consumer privacy in the context of “interest-based” or “tailored” advertising. Samba TV is an active member of the NAI and the DAA. We adhere to the NAI Code and implement the opt out mechanisms provided by the NAI and DAA: Web Browsers: You can opt out of having Samba use your web browsing information for “interest-based” or “tailored” advertisements by visiting http://optout.networkadvertising.org or https://optout.aboutads.info . Mobile Devices: For the most effective and up-to-date methods to limit ad tracking on your mobile device, please refer to your mobile operating system settings to see how you can opt out of “interest-based” or “tailored” advertisements, or reset your mobile device advertiser ID to unlink information previously associated with your advertiser ID. Please also review the NAI’s mobile opt-out instructions located at mobile-choice. For more information on opting out of targeted advertisements on mobile devices. Note, you will need to opt out on each browser on each of your devices. 8.3 Cookies And Local Storage If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or to clear local storage. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies or clear local storage, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services and may result in a new Samba TV cookie being created on your browser or device in the future. 8.4 Promotional Communications From time to time, we may send you marketing communications about our products and services, in accordance with your preferences. You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us at any time by following the instructions in those messages (often it will be a notice or link at the bottom of the message). Unless restricted by local regulations, we may still send you non-promotional communications about your account following your opt-out. 8.5 Mobile Push Notifications With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device. ‍ 9.

What Information We Receive\\nContent Viewing Information: We receive information about the content you view and interact with when you enable our Services in your Smart TV (“Content Viewing Information”). We may also receive Content Viewing Information if you enable a Smart TV App that integrates our Services. Content Viewing Information includes things like the title of the content, actions taken while viewing the content, and the length of time you viewed it.\\nLog Information: We automatically collect standard log files when you use our Services, which include the time and date of access, pages or features viewed, IP address, the type of web browser you use, and the referral URL.\\nDevice Information: We collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Services. This device-specific information may include the hardware model and brand, operating system, device identifiers, resource usage, and error logs. We may also discover when your Smart TV is available to connect with a mobile device, which can, for example, be used to make pairing your devices easier.\\nb. How We Receive This information\\nSmart TV Services: When you opt-in to our Smart TV Services, we may recognize the content played through your TV. Please note, we are only able to recognize public content, such as certain shows and movies. We won’t know when you’re watching, for example, home videos.\\nSmart TV Apps: We may receive such viewing information when you use our Smart TV Apps or third-party Smart TV apps that use our Integrated Services.\\nMobile Applications: We may receive information about your mobile device and the applications you are running on it. The information we receive may include, for instance, the mobile device’s advertising identifier (e.g. the IDFA or Google Android Ad ID).\\nCookies and Other Technologies: We use various technologies to collect information when you interact with our Services. These technologies include cookies, local storage and web beacons. Cookies and local storage are small data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies and local storage enable us and our customers to provide features and functionality (such as keeping you logged in), measure the popularity of our Services, and monitor their performance. Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website visits, and determine the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns. Our cookies are generally set to expire thirteen (13) months from the last time our systems encounter a particular computer or device.\\nInformation from Integrated Services: We collect information when you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Integrated Services, including through cookies and other technologies described above. For example, when you elect to pair a broadcaster’s app to your TV, that broadcaster can use our technology to synchronize your experience on their mobile apps as you watch a show on your TV. Also, third-party apps and websites can use our measurement and advertising services to better understand usage of their services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertisements. The information we collect includes information about your use of those websites and apps, as well as information those apps or websites enable us to collect from their services. For example, a streaming video provider may enable us to receive information about the content you watch so that our recommendation service can suggest additional content that you might like.\\n1.3 Information We Collect from Other Sources\\nWhere the law permits, we may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, we might obtain information from data providers and advertising exchange services, including assumed demographics and interests, and data about your engagement with certain ads. We may also obtain from our data providers household or unique device identifiers (such as IP Addresses and Advertising IDs) gathered across platforms (including websites, TV applications, or mobile applications) which may be combined with our data and distributed to our clients so they can better tailor their advertising, marketing, measurement, analytics, and research; our data providers who are contractually bound to comply with all applicable data privacy laws before collecting such data and providing it to us.\\n\\nAlso, if you create or log into your Samba TV account through a social media service, we will have access to certain information from that service based on the settings and authorizations you grant us through that service.",
