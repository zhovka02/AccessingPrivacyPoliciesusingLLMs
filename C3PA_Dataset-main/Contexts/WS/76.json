In addition, others (advertisers and ad networks, ad serving companies, or other service providers) may infer user interests based on interactions with, or clicks on, personalized ads or content.  As a result, you may see ads on our websites or other websites based on your purchases, search history, or web/mobile browsing activities (for instance, an ad from us may be displayed to you on another website if you recently browsed for office supplies). These interest-based ads (also sometimes called “personalized or targeted ads”) are displayed to you based on information collected from your online interactions across multiple websites that you visit, or across multiple devices you may use. Under applicable law in certain jurisdictions, the disclosure of your personal information to third parties in connection with targeted advertising or advertising analytics may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing/sharing of personal information. b.

How We Protect Your Personal Information We employ technical, physical, administrative, and organizational safeguards to help protect your Personal Information, including when you use our websites, mobile apps, in-store devices/equipment, services, etc. Our websites may contain links to other websites, services, social media platforms, etc. operated and maintained by partners.

Remember to log off your account and close your app/browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to help ensure that others do not access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

There is no obligation to opt-in, and you may opt-out at any time. The details of the programs are contained in the program offerings. We offer these programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. While we invest in our marketing and brands, consumer data is more valuable to our business when it is combined with a sufficient amount of other consumer data and after it is enhanced by our efforts described in this Privacy Notice. The value to our business of any individual consumer’s data is dependent on several factors, including, for example, whether and to what extent you take advantage or opt out of any offerings and whether we are able to enhance the data through our efforts described in this Privacy Notice. While we do not calculate the value of consumer data in our accounting statements, we provide this good faith summary for California residents. To the extent we create overall business value from our programs that could be directly or reasonably related to the value of consumer data, the method for calculating the value would include: a) costs related to maintaining the program including but not limited to IT infrastructure, delivery of offers, and marketing activities to enhance consumer data; b) whether the sales generated by the program exceeds the cost to us of offering the program including value of discounts to consumer; and c) value of the insights we are able to create based upon aggregate data. Data Retention: We retain all categories of your personal information for as long as is necessary, even if you are no longer an active customer, to provide the goods and services and to fulfill the transactions you have requested of us, and to support other necessary purposes such as: providing related business processes (such as returns or exchanges), resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements, fulfilling our legitimate interests (such as improving our products and services), responding to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf, preventing fraud, and complying with our legal obligations. In determining how long to retain information, we may consider various criteria such as the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, and the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information. The purposes and criteria for which we process the data may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information. De-identified Data: In instances where we de-identify your Personal Information to prevent it from being linked to you as an individual, we will maintain and use it in a de-identified format and will not attempt to re-identify the Personal Information. Non-Discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA Rights and we will not deny you goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide you with a lesser quality of goods or services if you exercise any of your CCPA/CPRA Rights.
