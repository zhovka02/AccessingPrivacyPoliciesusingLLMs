As used in this privacy policy, personal information means information about an individual that is collected or maintained for business purposes and by which the individual can be identified. Please note that information by which an individual cannot be identified (for example, anonymous, de-identified, or aggregate information) is not considered personal information and therefore is not subject to this policy. Please note that certain details of this policy may depend on whether you deal with us through an investment professional, directly as an individual investor, or whether Fidelity provides services to your employer or plan sponsor. In addition, some of Fidelity's products, services or digital offerings may have a different or additional privacy policy which may be made available to you if you choose to use those products, services or digital offerings. This policy is reviewed annually and updated to reﬂect any changes. Fidelity Investments privacy policy How and why we obtain and use personal information Fidelity recognizes the importance of maintaining personal information about you and when we use it, we do so with respect for your privacy. We obtain and use personal information about you to service, maintain, and protect your account; process transactions in your account; respond to inquiries from you or your representative; develop, offer, and deliver products and services; operate and manage our business; and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. Fidelity collects public and non-public personal information from customers and visitors from various sources. Some examples include: You or your representative on applications or forms (for example, when you interact with our customer service staff, and when you visit our websites or use our applications) You or your representative regarding your preferences (for example, your choice of electronic statement delivery, or the screen layout you specify if you use our websites) You or your employer or plan sponsor if Fidelity provides them with recordkeeping and/or employee benefits advisory services (for example, payroll, human resources, or benefits information) Transactional activity in your account (for example, trading history and balances) Other interactions with Fidelity (for example, discussions with our customer service staff, including telephone or chat, information you enter into our websites, or when you enroll in our authentication services) Information from consumer reporting agencies (for example, to assess your creditworthiness for margin products) Information from other third-party sources (for example, to verify your identity and to better understand your product and service needs) Other sources with your consent or with the consent of your representative (for example, from other institutions if you transfer positions into Fidelity) How we protect information about you We implement and maintain physical, administrative, technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology. At Fidelity, we restrict access to personal information to those who require it to develop, support, offer and deliver products and services to you and to operate our business. How we share information about you with third parties Fidelity does not share or sell personal information about our customers with unaffiliated third parties for use in marketing their products and services. We may share personal information with the following entities: Unaffiliated service providers (for example, printing and mailing companies, securities clearinghouses, marketing service providers, and other entities who may provide services at Fidelity's direction) Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (for example, for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions) Other third-parties, with your consent or as directed by your representative (for example, if you request to transfer assets from another financial institution, or if you use an external aggregation website or service that you have provided permission to access your Fidelity financial account on your behalf) Other third parties whose products, services and investment offerings are made available through Fidelity, and which you decide to utilize Other organizations as permitted or required by law (for example for fraud prevention or to respond to a subpoena) In connection with corporate business transactions, such as a merger or sale of a business. Our service providers are obligated to keep the personal information we share with them confidential and use it only to provide services specified by Fidelity. In addition, if you choose to use or indicate your interest in using a product, service or investment offering that is offered by a third party and made available through Fidelity, we may share personal information with that third party in connection with your use or interest of that product, service or investment offering. Based on the nature of your relationship with Fidelity, we may exchange information with other third parties as described below: If Fidelity provides workplace services to your employer or plan sponsor, such as payroll, human resources or employee benefits advisory and/or recordkeeping services, Fidelity may exchange any information received in connection with such services with your employer or plan sponsor or others they may authorize. If you conduct business with Fidelity through your investment professional, we may exchange information we collect with your investment professional or with others they may authorize. If you transact business through Fidelity's life insurance companies, we may validate and obtain information about you from an insurance support organization. The insurance support organization may further share your information with other insurers, as permitted by law. We may also share medical information about you to learn if you qualify for coverage, to process claims, to prevent fraud, or otherwise at your direction, as permitted by law. How we provide information about you with our affiliates We may provide personal information about you to various Fidelity corporate affiliates including internal service providers which perform, for example, printing, mailing, and data processing services. If you interact with Fidelity directly as an individual investor (including joint account holders), we may provide certain information about you to Fidelity affiliates, such as our brokerage and insurance companies, for their use in marketing products and services as allowed by law. Where Fidelity provides services to you under an arrangement with your employer or plan sponsor, to the extent permitted by you or under our agreement with your employer or plan sponsor and as allowed by law, we may provide information about you to Fidelity's affiliates, such as our brokerage and insurance companies, for their use in marketing products and services. Information collected from investment professionals' customers is not provided to Fidelity affiliates for marketing purposes, except with your or your representatives' consent and as allowed by law.

Additional Information for California Residents This section is provided for purposes related to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the \"CPRA\") and applies solely to the personal information and Fidelity companies that are subject to the CPRA. As used in this section, \"personal information\" means information that meets the definition of \"personal information\" as set forth in the CPRA and is not otherwise excluded from the scope of the CPRA. Fidelity companies and the CPRA Depending on the Fidelity company with which you have a relationship or otherwise interact, the nature of your relationship and interactions with that Fidelity company, and the products and services provided to you through that relationship, some or all of the personal information that the Fidelity company collects or maintains is covered by one or more of the exemptions described below (see the section below entitled \"CPRA Exemptions\"). As a result, in some cases, the applicable Fidelity company may have no obligation under the CPRA to accept any CPRA requests, and in other cases, it may have no obligation to honor a particular CPRA request, because of the nature of the personal information that the Fidelity company collects or maintains. Here are some examples of CPRA exemptions: If your relationship and interactions with a Fidelity company consist solely of personal financial services (e.g., maintaining one or more personal brokerage accounts), the personal information collected and processed about you is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") and therefore your CPRA request will not be honored by the Fidelity company. If you participate in a workplace retirement plan, or other employee benefit plan sponsored by or provided through your employer, that is serviced or administered by a Fidelity company, CPRA requests should be directed to your employer . Your Rights Under the CPRA The CPRA gives certain rights to California residents and imposes certain obligations on those businesses that are subject to the CPRA. As required by the CPRA, set forth below is a description of certain rights that California residents generally have under the CPRA. As used below, a \"consumer\" means a resident of the State of California and a \"covered business\" means a business that is subject to the CPRA. Right to Know/Right to Access. A consumer has the right to request that a covered business that collects a consumer's personal information disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of information the business has collected. A consumer also has the right to request that a covered business that collects a consumer's personal information disclose to that consumer the following: The categories of personal information it has collected about that consumer The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing (if applicable) personal information The categories of third parties to whom the covered business discloses personal information The specific pieces of personal information that the covered business has collected about that consumer These disclosures are not required to include any information about activity that occurred prior to January 1, 2022. Please also note that a covered business is not required to honor more than 2 of these requests from the same consumer during any 12-month period. Right to Delete. A consumer has the right to request that a covered business delete any personal information that the business has collected from the consumer, subject to certain exceptions. Right to Correct. A consumer has the right to request that a covered business correct inaccurate personal information that a business maintains about a consumer. Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing. If a covered business sells or shares personal information, a consumer has the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information by the business. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. If a covered business uses or discloses sensitive personal information for reasons other than those set forth in the CPRA, a consumer has the right to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information by the business. Non-Discrimination. A consumer has the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by the covered business for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CPRA. Categories of personal information we may collect about you In general, if you are a customer of ours or you otherwise interact with us, we collect various types of personal information about you.

In addition to those purposes described above, below are additional business or commercial purposes for which we collect personal information: To provide you with information about products and services that may interest you To maintain the accuracy and integrity of our records For marketing and communication purposes For reporting and analytical purposes For personalizing your interactions and experiences with us For training and quality-control measures To verify your identity To protect against malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity For business analysis, planning, and reporting For customer education For effectiveness measurements Categories of personal information disclosed for business purposes Like most businesses, we disclose personal information, including in some cases certain sensitive personal information, to third parties for our business purposes. Depending on the nature of your relationship and your interactions with us, and on the products and services that we provide to you, we disclose to third parties for business purposes the personal information that is encompassed by one or more of the categories described in the \"Categories of personal information we may collect about you\" section above, with the categories of third parties listed in the section above entitled \"How we share information about you with third parties\" . Selling/sharing of personal information We DO NOT sell your personal information for payment or for any other compensation. However, some of the ways in which we share your personal information with third parties on certain of our Websites may, under the CPRA, be considered to be a “sale” of personal information or “sharing” of personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” (as those terms are used in the CPRA). We engage third party service providers, including marketing and advertising providers, and social media platforms (providers) to personalize your browsing experience on our Websites, to provide certain targeted advertising services for us, and to help us measure the effectiveness of our Websites and our online advertising. When you visit our Websites, we and our providers collect certain information about your activity on our Websites, including cookies and similar data stored on or collected from your browser or device. In some cases, our providers may combine this information collected on our Websites with information about your activity on other, unaffiliated websites or social media platforms to deliver our ads to you when you are visiting other websites or platforms. This sharing of your information with certain third parties via cookies and similar methods, and our providers' use of certain cookies, may be considered to be a \"sale\" of personal information or \"sharing\" of personal information for \"cross-context behavioral advertising\" under the CPRA. California residents covered by the CPRA have the right to opt out of this \"sale\" or \"sharing\" of personal information. For those Websites where we engage in these activities and are covered by the CPRA, if we determine that you are visiting the Website from a location in California, you will see a \"Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\" link on the footer of the Website's homepage. To opt out of this sale or sharing of your personal information, please click on the link and follow the prompts. Note that Fidelity permits all visitors to certain portions of our fidelity.com website (for example, the homepage at www.fidelity.com) to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of this sale or sharing of this personal information through the use of the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal without having to make individualized opt-out requests. If you've enabled the GPC signal in your browser, we will honor your request to opt-out of this sale or sharing of personal information as communicated via the GPC signal. These opt-outs (whether via the toggle above or via the GPC signal) are a setting that is specific to the device or browser you're using. You'll need to opt out again if you visit our applicable Websites from a different device or browser, change your browser settings, or clear your cookies. In the 12 months preceding the date of this Notice, we \"sold\" and/or \"shared\" personal information for \"cross-context behavioral advertising\", with respect to California residents covered by the CPRA. We do not knowingly \"sell\" or \"share\" for \"cross-context behavioral advertising\" personal information of minors under 16 years of age. CPRA Exemptions Please note that certain types of personal information collected or maintained by a covered business are exempt from the CPRA. For example, a covered business has limited obligations, or in some cases, no obligations, under the CPRA with regard to the following types of personal information: Personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102) and implementing regulations, or pursuant to the California Financial Information Privacy Act (Division 1.4 [commencing with Section 4050] of the California Financial Code) Medical information governed by the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act or protected health information that is collected by a covered entity or business associate pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In addition, some businesses are not subject to the CPRA, such as: A business that does not do business in the State of California A business that is not organized or operated for the profit of financial benefit of its shareholders or other owners A business that does not determine the purposes and means of the processing of consumers' personal information A business that has annual gross revenue of $25,000,000 or less Furthermore, under the CPRA, there are a number of situations where a covered business under the CPRA may refuse to honor a CPRA request to delete a consumer's personal information and is allowed to continue to maintain the personal information. Some examples include situations where retention of the personal information is reasonably necessary to: Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer or reasonably anticipated within the context of the covered business’s ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the Fidelity company and the consumer Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of the personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes Debugging to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer's right of free speech, or exercise another right provided by law To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on the consumer's relationship with the business and compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information Comply with a legal obligation Please note that the description of the CPRA set forth in this privacy policy is a summary of only certain aspects of the CPRA and is not and should not be considered a complete description of the CPRA. In addition to what is described above, the CPRA includes other exemptions that apply to particular types of personal information and particular businesses, as well as additional situations where a covered business is not required to honor a consumer’s request to delete the consumer's personal information. Submitting a CPRA Request If you wish to submit a CPRA request to any of the Fidelity companies listed in this privacy policy, you may initiate your request through one of the options provided on our California Privacy Rights Request Page . Before submitting your request, please ensure you have reviewed all the CPRA exemptions, including those described above under the section above entitled \"CPRA Exemptions\" . You should generally expect to receive a response within 45 days of the date we receive your request. However, in some instances, we may require an additional 45 days to process your request in which case we will notify you and explain why the extension is necessary. We will need to verify your identity before we can process your request. Through the request process, we will make you aware of any information that you will need to provide to us to process your request. You may have to confirm that you are a California resident and verify your identity or the identities of those authorized to submit requests on your behalf. Additionally, the information you provide will be used to help verify your identity. To understand how you can designate an authorized agent with the ability to make a request under the CPRA on your behalf, please refer to our California Privacy Rights Request page . Fidelity companies covered by this privacy policy received 12 CCPA requests for disclosure of personal information (request to know) and 18 CCPA requests for deletion of personal information (request to delete) between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Fidelity companies responded to each of these requests in an average of 10.46 days. However, because of exemptions under the CPRA, Fidelity companies did not comply with any of these requests.
