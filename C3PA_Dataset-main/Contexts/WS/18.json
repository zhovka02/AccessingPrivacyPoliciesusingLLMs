How Is Your Information Collected?: You Provide It to Us We collect information that you enter on our digital properties or give to us in other ways (e.g., when you contact Guest Relations, order on Target.com, purchase a product in a Target store or create a gift registry). Automated Information Collection We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target Guest. If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc. In order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile application(s), the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts. Third-party Automated Collection We and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services. We also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process. The tags may collect information from your interactions on Target.com. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party companies. Please contact these third-party companies (e.g., Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags. Social Media Widgets Our sites and mobile application(s) include social media features, such as the Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third-party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. Mobile Location Information If you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile application(s), services or our service providers. For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores; or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more. To manage how you share your device’s location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy. Cameras We use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security. When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., see item in your space) or virtual try on services (e.g., try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from your device’s camera for these services is used in real time and is not stored on the servers. The virtual try on experience operates within your own device or browser and the data is deleted after the experience ends. Information From Other Sources We collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing Guest information and improve the accuracy of our records. This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing. Back to Top 3. How Is Your Information Used?

For mobile platforms that require opt-in consent to link or track user or device data, unless you consent, Target does not link or track user or device data collected from Target application(s) with user or device data collected from other companies’ applications, websites or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. If a guest provides opt-in consent to the linking and use of data with a specifically identified third party partner, such data may be linked and may be used by Target and/or the third party partner as described at the time consent is obtained, including for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. Cross-Device Linking We may also link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in a relevant experience on another device. This allows us to deliver more personalized and consistent advertising to you. For example, if you purchase a product on our website using your desktop, we are able to avoid showing you an advertisement on the same product on your mobile phone; if you add an item to your cart on Target.com through your mobile device, but leave Target.com without purchasing the item, we are able to show you that item in your cart on another device. Interest-Based Advertising We participate in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as online behavioral advertising (OBA). We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile application(s). This information is used to serve ads for Target products or services or for the products or services of other companies when you visit this website or other websites. These companies use non-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information. Target adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA. User Experience Information In order to improve Guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our Guest Relations representatives in resolving issues Guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g., information entered during checkout process), browser and device information. Social Media We engage with Guests on multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request Guest service via social media, or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use. Social Media Ads We may display targeted ads to you through social media platforms. These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics. For example, we may target people who have expressed an interest in shopping for groceries, cosmetics, clothing, etc. See the policies of each social media platform for additional information about these types of ads.

Cookies, Tracking, and Interest-Based Advertising The help function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features. To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on. Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third-party. Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or application(s), or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target. To opt-out of our interest-based advertising for Target’s goods and services or those of another party, online and in third-party mobile applications, visit Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page here and perform a global opt-out. Options you select are browser and device specific. To learn more about interest-Based Advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website .

If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again. Do Not Track Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals.

If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.\\n\\nIn order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile application(s), the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.\\n\\nThird-party Automated Collection\\n\\nWe and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.\\n\\nWe also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process. The tags may collect information from your interactions on Target.com. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party companies. Please contact these third-party companies (e.g., Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags.\\n\\nSocial Media Widgets\\nOur sites and mobile application(s) include social media features, such as the Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third-party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.\\n\\nMobile Location Information\\nIf you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile application(s), services or our service providers. For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores; or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more.\\n\\nTo manage how you share your device’s location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy.\\n\\nCameras\\nWe use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security. When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g., Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., see item in your space) or virtual try on services (e.g., try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from your device’s camera for these services is used in real time and is not stored on the servers. The virtual try on experience operates within your own device or browser and the data is deleted after the experience ends.\\n\\nInformation From Other Sources\\nWe collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing Guest information and improve the accuracy of our records. This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing.",
