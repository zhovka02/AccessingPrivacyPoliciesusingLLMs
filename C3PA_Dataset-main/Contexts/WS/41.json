For example, some clients hire ZipRecruiter to send job alert emails to their job seekers who have requested job\n        alert emails from such clients. In these cases, ZipRecruiter acts as a service provider ( i.e ., data\n        processor) to the client, who is the data controller. When ZipRecruiter provides services in the capacity of a\n        service provider, it acts under the instructions and at the direction of such client ( i.e ., the data\n        controller). In the foregoing example, if you are a job seeker who has requested job alert emails from one of our\n        clients, the client will provide us certain Personal Data about you (such as your name, email address, the type of\n        job you want, and your preferred geographic location) to ensure that the job alert emails meet your search\n        criteria.

HOW WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR DATA top We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the\n        law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only\n        permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and this\n        Privacy Policy. Below we explain in more detail how ZipRecruiter shares or discloses your Personal Data outside of ZipRecruiter. A. Disclosures of Personal Data at Your Direction We disclose your Personal Data when you intentionally interact with third parties and when you direct us or intentionally use ZipRecruiter to share your Personal Data in connection with the services that we provide to you. For example: If you are a job seeker, we will share your Personal Data as follows: If you apply to a job posting on our Website, we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with the prospective employer\n              and/or their agent of the job to which you applied, including but not limited to, any external Applicant\n              Tracking System or any other external systems used by the direct employer to manage the hiring of employees or\n              other categories of workers. If you have opted-in to our Resume Database (where such feature is available), we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data\n              with prospective employers, recruiters, and/or their agents\n              or representative that are permitted to have access to the Resume Database.\n              You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by updating this\n              preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account.\n              However, if an entity has already accessed your Identity Data or Contact Data through the Resume Database or via the search\n              results, and copied or otherwise saved your information prior to you opting-out, that entity will continue to\n              have access to the information that was previously saved. If you are invited to and choose to participate in a video call with a Client (“ Video Intro ”), your\n              Identity Data and Contact Data will be shared with the employer that invited you to the call. For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate\n              in new features and functions available through the Services. Please Note: Please ensure that the profile information and resume associated with your account is\n        up-to-date, so when you apply for a job vacancy or participate in a Video Intro call through a ZipRecruiter Website,\n        the employer receives your most recent resume and/or profile information. When you apply to a job vacancy using the\n        “Apply Now” button, you will be given the option to use the resume saved to your profile or use a different resume\n        before submitting the application. If you apply to a job using “1-Click Apply”, ZipRecruiter will automatically send\n        the existing resume in your account. If you want to send a different resume, please replace the resume currently in\n        your account before you use the “1-Click Apply” feature. You will have an account with ZipRecruiter if you opened an\n        account yourself, signed up for job alerts, applied for a job on the ZipRecruiter website and/or when you ‘verify skills’\n        for another user. You can delete or replace your resume by going to the ‘Profile’ settings in your account. If you would\n        like to change the resume you used to apply to a previous job posting, you can go to the “Applied Jobs” page in your\n        ZipRecruiter account, and click “Replace Resume” to replace the resume used to apply to a particular job vacancy. If you are a Client, we will share your Personal Data as follows: If you invite job seekers to participate in a Video Intro call, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared\n            with the job seekers that are invited to the call. If you authorize ZipRecruiter to send automated personalized invitations or other communications to candidates on your\n            behalf, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with candidates that are invited to connect with you and/or apply\n            to your job. For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new\n            features and functions available through the Services. B.

For example: Fraud prevention and identity verification services where we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our customers or others.

Upon your authorization, the Services may also post information directly to the timeline of your Connected Site Account. From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (\" Events \") on our Services together with a third-party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve.

This may also include taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service and other authorities acting as processors based in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other applicable countries, who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

D. Sale of Personal Data or Use for Targeted Advertising Your privacy is our priority, and we do not monetize your Personal Data by selling it to third parties. After you visit our Website and/or use our Services, you may receive targeted advertisements about ZipRecruiter when you visit other websites (i.e., social media sites, search engines or other websites that are unrelated to ZipRecruiter) (collectively, “Other Websites”). This happens because we use third-party vendors to provide you with information about our Services based upon your interactions with our Website.  We also may place third-party cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website to track your interactions with ZipRecruiter ads placed on Other Websites. These third-party vendors may additionally collect certain Personal Data about you through cookies and other tracking technologies (see our Cookie Policy for more information). These third-party vendors may work with additional downstream providers in their relationship network that assist the third-party vendor in providing the advertising services to us.  When this information is disclosed by ZipRecruiter in the manner described above, it may constitute a “sale” or “use for targeted advertising” under applicable privacy laws. We disclose the following categories of Personal Data with third party advertising partners or advertising networks for the purpose of showing you ads about ZipRecruiter Services: Identity Data Contact Data Transaction Data Business Information Profile Data 7. WHERE YOUR DATA IS TRANSFERED top ZipRecruiter, Inc. is headquartered in the United States of America (USA). The information that you provide or\n        that we collect as a result of your interaction with the Website and/or your use of our Services is transferred to\n        the USA and/or to another country where we have a subsidiary or where we have engaged service providers. As a\n        result, your Personal Data may be subject to data protection and other laws that may differ from your country of\n        residence. Your Personal Data may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from governmental or\n        regulatory authorities in the countries in which we and/or our service providers operate. 8. HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT top Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate\n        retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to,\n        the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations\n        in relation to that Personal Data\n        (e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations), whether our relationship with you is ongoing (e.g., where you use\n        more than one of our products and/or services), any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion\n        of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights\n        (e.g., the defense of any claims).\n        In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in\n        which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain or securely delete or destroy your Personal Data\n        subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no\n        further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid\n        sending you unwanted materials in the future. 9.

ZipRecruiter as a Data Processor In certain instances, ZipRecruiter acts as a data processor to its clients and is provided Personal Data by such\n        clients ( i.e ., the data controller) . In such case, we process Personal Data under the\n        direction of that client (the data controller) and have no direct relationship with the individuals (data subjects) whose Personal Data we process. Where ZipRecruiter processes your Personal Data in the capacity of a data processor, and you seek access, or want\n        to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data, or have other requests, we will provide you with the data\n        controller’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however, circumstances may\n        necessitate ZipRecruiter to assist you with your question or request. For example, some clients hire ZipRecruiter to send job alert emails to job seekers who have requested job alert\n        emails from such clients. In these cases, ZipRecruiter acts as a data processor to the client, who is the data\n        controller. When ZipRecruiter provides services in the capacity of a data processor, it acts under the\n        instructions and at the direction of such client ( i.e ., the data controller) . In the\n        foregoing example, if you are a job seeker who has requested job alert emails from one of our clients, the client\n        will provide us certain Personal Data about you (such as your name, email address, the type of job you want, and\n        your preferred geographic location) to ensure that the job alert emails meet your search criteria. If you have\n        questions or requests about your Personal Data with respect to the job alert emails, we will provide you with the\n        data controllers contact information so that you can contact the data controller directly. Where we provide services in the capacity of a data processor, we may need to share your Personal Data with\n        subprocessors that help us provide services to you on behalf of our data controller clients. Transfers to such\n        subprocessor are addressed in the contracts we have with the subprocessors and the data controller clients that\n        originally provided your Personal Data to us. Personal Data that we process as a data processor is retained by us only for the duration required to service the\n        data controller client, and/or in accordance with the instructions from such client, and/or as necessary to comply\n        with our legal obligations. 5.

Some countries that are not located within the EU or\n        U.K. may be recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection. For transfers\n        from the EU or U.K. to countries not considered as adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place\n        measures, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your\n        Personal Data, which can be found at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en .\n        When we transfer Personal Data from the EU, U.K., or Switzerland to the USA, we also adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “ Data Privacy Framework ”) and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, as described in our Data Privacy Framework certification, which you can find at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TNnuAAG&status=Active . 8. How long your data will be kept top Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate\n        retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to,\n        the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations\n        in relation to that Personal Data\n        (e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations), whether our relationship with you is ongoing (e.g., where you use\n        more than one of our products and/or services), any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion\n        of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights\n        (e.g., the defense of any claims).\n        In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in\n        which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain or securely delete or destroy your Personal Data\n        subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no\n        further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid\n        sending you unwanted materials in the future. 9. YOUR DATA SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS top Data subjects in the EEA, Switzerland, and U.K. have the following rights with respect to their Personal Data: YOUR RIGHTS WHAT CAN YOU REQUEST Right to Information The right to know what Personal Data we hold about you and how we use it. Right to Access The right to be provided with a copy of your Personal Data (subject to certain restrictions). Right of Rectification The right to require us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data we hold\n                  about you, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. If you\n                have a user account with us, you also have the option of correcting your information directly in your\n                account. Right to erasure/be forgotten This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Data where there is no good reason for us to\n                continue to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request for\n                erasure and in such circumstances, will notify our reasons to you. Right to restrict processing The right to require us to restrict processing of your Personal Data, i.e., you can\n                  request that we suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if\n                you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not\n                want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it\n                to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we\n                need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Right to request data portability In certain circumstances, you have the right to re quest the transfer of your\n                Personal Data to you or to a third party in a commonly used machine-readable format. Note, however, that\n                this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or\n                where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Right to object to processing You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data in the following circumstances: (i)\n                at any time to your Personal Data being processed for direct marketing (including profiling); or (ii) in\n                certain other situations, to our continued processing of your Personal Data, e.g., our\n                  processing of your Personal Data when such processing is based on our legitimate interests. In some\n                  cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which\n                  override your rights and freedoms. Right to withdraw consent at any time You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your\n                Personal Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you\n                withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or\n                services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision-making The right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing\n                  (including profiling) that produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.\n                  However, your right does not apply if: (i) you gave us your explicit consent to use your Personal\n                Data to make our decision; (ii) we are allowed by law to make our decision; or (iii) our automated\n                decision was necessary to enable us to enter into a contract with you. “Post-mortem” Right (for data subjects residing in France) This right allows you to define directives relating to the conservation, deletion, and communication of your personal data after your death, under the conditions provided for in Article 85 of Law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 relating to information technology, files and freedoms as amended. In particular, you may register your specific directives - i.e. the directives indicating how your personal data relating to certain processing operations identified in the said directives are to be processed after your death - with us. You may revoke or change your instructions at any time. Compliance with the instructions is without prejudice to the provisions applicable to public records containing personal data. Method for Requesting Information Pursuant to Your Rights Upon request, ZipRecruiter will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal\n        Data. If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the table above ( each,\n        a “Rights Request” ), please send an email to dsars@ziprecruiter.com and identify the specific website to which your request relates. No Fee Usually Required You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other\n        rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\n        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances and, in such\n          case, we will notify you within a reasonable timeframe regarding our reasons for refusing to act on your\n          request . What We May Need from You Once we receive your Rights Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your\n        identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a\n        security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. If we are not clear as to what you are requesting, we may also need to contact you for clarification so we can\n        more fully respond to your request. If we cannot locate any records about you, we may also ask you for additional information to assist us in\n        locating records, if they exist. Time Limit to Respond We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if\n        your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and\n        keep you updated. 10.

We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and this Privacy Policy. Below we explain in more detail how ZipRecruiter shares or discloses your Personal Data outside of ZipRecruiter.\n\nA. Disclosures of Personal Data at Your Direction\nWe disclose your Personal Data when you intentionally interact with third parties and when you direct us or intentionally use ZipRecruiter to share your Personal Data in connection with the services that we provide to you. For example:\n\nIf you are a job seeker, we will share your Personal Data as follows:\nIf you apply to a job posting on our Website, we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with the prospective employer and/or their agent of the job to which you applied, including but not limited to, any external Applicant Tracking System or any other external systems used by the direct employer to manage the hiring of employees or other categories of workers.\nIf you have opted-in to our Resume Database (where such feature is available), we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with prospective employers, recruiters, and/or their agents or representative that are permitted to have access to the Resume Database. You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by updating this preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account. However, if an entity has already accessed your Identity Data or Contact Data through the Resume Database or via the search results, and copied or otherwise saved your information prior to you opting-out, that entity will continue to have access to the information that was previously saved.\nIf you are invited to and choose to participate in a video call with a Client (“Video Intro”), your Identity Data and Contact Data will be shared with the employer that invited you to the call.\nFor any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.\nPlease Note: Please ensure that the profile information and resume associated with your account is up-to-date, so when you apply for a job vacancy or participate in a Video Intro call through a ZipRecruiter Website, the employer receives your most recent resume and/or profile information. When you apply to a job vacancy using the “Apply Now” button, you will be given the option to use the resume saved to your profile or use a different resume before submitting the application. If you apply to a job using “1-Click Apply”, ZipRecruiter will automatically send the existing resume in your account. If you want to send a different resume, please replace the resume currently in your account before you use the “1-Click Apply” feature. You will have an account with ZipRecruiter if you opened an account yourself, signed up for job alerts, applied for a job on the ZipRecruiter website and/or when you ‘verify skills’ for another user. You can delete or replace your resume by going to the ‘Profile’ settings in your account. If you would like to change the resume you used to apply to a previous job posting, you can go to the “Applied Jobs” page in your ZipRecruiter account, and click “Replace Resume” to replace the resume used to apply to a particular job vacancy.\n\nIf you are a Client, we will share your Personal Data as follows:\nIf you invite job seekers to participate in a Video Intro call, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with the job seekers that are invited to the call.\nIf you authorize ZipRecruiter to send automated personalized invitations or other communications to candidates on your behalf, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with candidates that are invited to connect with you and/or apply to your job.\nFor any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.",
