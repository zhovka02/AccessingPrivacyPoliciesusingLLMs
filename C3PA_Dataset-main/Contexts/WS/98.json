How We Use Cookies Like many other companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”). Cookies are small files of information that are stored by your web browser software on your computer hard drive, mobile or other devices (e.g., smartphones or tablets). We use Cookies to: Estimate audience size and usage patterns; Understand and save your preferences for future visits, allowing us to customize the Site and Services to your individual needs; Advertise new content and services that relate to your interests; Keep track of advertisements and search engine results; Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions to resolve issues and offer better site experiences and tools in the future; and Recognize when you return to the Site.

For example, we use Cookies from Google, and other similar companies. How You Can Opt Out of Cookies You can block Cookies by changing your Internet browser settings to refuse all or some Cookies. If you choose to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of the Site. You can find out more about Cookies and how to manage them by visiting www.AboutCookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org .

Google Analytics We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses Cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with the Site and Services, compile reports on their activity, and provide other services related to their activity and usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a returning visitor, and any referring website.

Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms The Site recognizes the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) signal.

To download and use a browser supporting the GPC browser signal, click here: https://globalprivacycontrol.org/orgs . If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. Some internet browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Given that there is not a uniform way that browsers communicate the “Do Not Track” signal, the Site does not currently interpret, respond to or alter its practices when it receives “Do Not Track” signals.

Notice of Financial Incentive From time to time, you may have the opportunity to provide Personal Information in exchange for discounts and price differences. For example, we require certain personal information from you to sign up for the AMC Stubs loyalty program. AMC Stubs loyalty program members receive birthday rewards, upgrades on food and beverage items, waived convenience fees, and accrual of points that they may redeem. Categories of Personal Information that we may collect when you sign up for an AMC Stubs account include your name, email address, phone number, birth date, physical address, and location. How to Opt In and Right to Withdraw Signing up for the AMC Stubs loyalty program is optional. By providing your Personal Information during the AMC Stubs loyalty program sign-up process, you affirmatively opt in to receiving the financial incentive and to joining our loyalty program. You have the right to withdraw from the financial incentive at any time. If you opt out of receiving a financial incentive, we will not reduce the value of any financial incentives you previously received from us. If you wish to withdraw from receiving the financial incentive, you may submit such a request at any time by deleting your AMC Stubs loyalty account or by submitting a request through our interactive webform here or by calling us at 1-800-576-7849. How the Financial Incentive is Reasonably Related to the Value of Your Personal Information The financial incentive or price difference is reasonably related to the value provided by your Personal Information. We take into consideration, without limitation, the anticipated revenue generated from such information, the anticipated expenses which we might incur in the collection, storage, and use of such information, and the anticipated expenses which we might incur related to the offer, provision, and imposition of the loyalty program. Based on this analysis, the value of your Personal Information that allows us to make these offers and financial incentives is the value of the offer itself or as described in further detail below. AMC Stubs A*List and Premier members accrue one hundred (100) points per dollar spent. AMC Stubs Insider members accrue twenty (20) points per dollar spent. Each time a member accrues 5,000 points, the member receives a redeemable five-dollar ($5.00) reward. The value of upgrades on food and beverage items and birthday rewards (including free popcorn for all AMC Stubs members and a free drink for AMC Stubs A*List and Premiere members) vary by geographic location, and may be determined based on the listed price of the item at the location where the member redeems the reward. The value of a waived convenience fee varies by geographic location and point of sale, and may be determined based on the stated convenience fee as set forth at the point of sale. Shine the Light Law We do not disclose personal information obtained through our Site or Services to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Accordingly, we have no obligations under California Civil Code § 1798.83. Back to Top 12.
