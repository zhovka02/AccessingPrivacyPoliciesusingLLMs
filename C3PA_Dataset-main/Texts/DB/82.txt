Commitment to Privacy DSG respects privacy and are committed to protecting personal information, or information identifying a natural person (“Personal Data”).  In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the types of Personal Data we collect; why we collect it; the lawful bases for doing so; how we collect Personal Data, use Personal Data, and disclose Personal Data; and any of your rights, including access to your Personal Data. Application of This Policy This Policy applies to the Personal Data we collect when you purchase or use any of our Products and Services, including visits to our website at demandscience.com (“Website”). This Policy also applies to Business Contact Information (“BCI”) that is readily available in the public domain, such as business name, first and last name, business telephone number, job titles, work e-mail addresses and location in which a business is located and an individual works.  BCI information is collected and maintained in our B2B database.  Affiliates offering our Products and Services that also determine the purposes and means of processing BCI Information are Leadiro UK Limited and DS Intelligence LLC. By purchasing or using our Products and Services, or reading this Policy, you agree that your Personal Data will be handled as described in this Policy. Your purchase or use of the Products and Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our applicable Terms of Use, including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. The Terms of Use are incorporated by reference into this Policy. By purchasing or using our Products and Services, or reading this Policy, you are deemed to have agreed to the provisions of this Policy, unless you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), or Switzerland, in which case you are acknowledging that you have been provided this Policy. Without prejudice to your rights under applicable laws, this Policy is not contractual and does not form a part of your contract with DSG or its affiliates or subsidiaries. In addition, this Policy applies to Personal Data we collect or use about job applicants or employees who are California residents (“Job Applicant and Employee Data”). We collect, use, and disclose Job Applicant and Employee Data for different reasons than other Personal Data we may collect, use, or disclose. For more information about how we collect, use, or disclose Job Applicant and Employee Data, please scroll down to the section titled “Additional Information for Job Applicants and Employees About the CCPA”. If you would like more information, please contact us using the information in section “20. Contact Us” below. What Personal Data Do We Collect About You and Why? Personal Data, as we use it in this Policy, means information that directly identifies you and therefore, can be associated with you. This includes, but is not limited to, your first and last name, and contact information such as your physical address, email address, Internet Protocol address (“IP address”) and phone number.  Personal Data may also include your professional or employment-related details and details regarding your interaction with our Website or email marketing. Personal Data We Collect Directly from You. If you request a whitepaper or other specific content, subscribe to our newsletters, or complete the web form on the Contact Us page, we ask you to fill out a brief form that requests information such as your name, company, title, e-mail address, and telephone, as well as your areas of interest and of course the content of any message to us. Similarly, if you provide comments on any blog or community page we may host, you will need to log in – although you may do that via your social network account such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Of course, we collect information from you when you respond to an online or a telemarketing survey. Our Website may include social media features or widgets, such as the Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter buttons. These features may also collect your IP address, which pages you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie (see below) even if you do not ‘click’ on the social media widget. These features may also give you the option to post information about your activities on our Website to your social media profile page to share with others within your network. Your interactions with these widgets and any data they may collect even if you do not click on them are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them. Personal Data We Receive from Information Readily Available in the Public Domain. DSG affirmatively collects and receives BCI from various third-party sources, including our partners.  BCI is information pertaining to businesses and individuals that is readily available in the public domain, including but not limited to:  business name, first and last name, business telephone number, job titles, work e-mail addresses and location in which a business is located and an individual works. We collect this information to provide our Products and Services to our customers. Personal Data We Collect Automatically.

For marketing purposes. For example, we may use your Personal Data, such as your email address or phone number, to send you content, surveys, news and newsletters, or to otherwise contact you about our Products and Services or information we think may interest you. We may also use automatically collected Personal Data to determine whether and how you have interacted with any email messages we have sent you. To provide our customers with access to a database of accurate business data records including BCI which enables them to promote their goods and services employing direct marketing to the right people (i.e., decision makers, influencers, champions) in other businesses, and to promote your business so it can be found when it is searched for by other businesses. To better understand how visitors access and use our Website, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Website. For testing, research, analysis, and our development of our Products and Services. To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data held by us about our Website users is among the assets transferred. If we would like to use your Personal Data for any purposes other than those described, we will obtain your prior consent unless there are other lawful bases for processing your Personal Data ( please see below at Section 7 ). How We Disclose Your Personal Data We may disclose your Personal Data within DSG, and externally with third parties as discussed below. When we disclose your Personal Data, we enter into a contractually binding agreement with the recipient of the Personal Data which requires the recipient to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK GDPR, the Canadian Personal Data Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), as well as any implementing regulation thereof of any jurisdiction, and any applicable data privacy laws and regulations of the United States or any US state, Canada, or any other relevant jurisdictions. Internally, Within DSG. We may disclose your Personal Data internally, within DSG. This may involve disclosing your Personal Data outside of the EEA and the UK.  All DSG subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into an intra-company transfer agreement committing to compliance with the GDPR, UK GDPR, PIPEDA, as well all other applicable data privacy laws. Other Website Visitors . If you post a comment on the blog pages or any other public area of our Website, your comment and identity will be available to, and searchable by, all users of our Website. This does not apply to any personal data you provide in a Contact Us inquiry. Upon Your Request or Instruction . When you request content from us or we present you with an online or telemarketing survey, we will typically obtain your direction to disclose limited Personal Data between DSG subsidiaries or affiliates, or specified business customers. Service Providers . We may disclose the personal data we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, sub-processors, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf. We only disclose Personal Data to our service providers for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. We require that these parties only process the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with this Policy. Customers and Partners. We may disclose your Personal Data with our customers and partners under lawful bases, including Consent and/or Legitimate Interest ( please see Section 7, below ). Business Transfers . If DSG or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are acquired by or merged with another organization, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another organization, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the personal data we have collected from you to the other organization. In Response to Legal Process . We also may disclose the Personal Data we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena. To Protect Us and Others . We also may disclose the Personal Data we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. Other Purposes If we would like to disclose your Personal Data for any purposes other than those described, we will obtain your prior consent, unless there are other lawful bases for processing your Personal Data ( please see Section 7, below ). Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data We process Personal Data in accordance with all applicable data privacy laws and regulations.  If you are located in the European Union or Switzerland, the GDPR applies. If you are located in the UK, the UK GDPR applies. Under either, there are six lawful bases for processing of Personal Data: Consent. The processing is based on demonstrable, freely given, informed, and revocable consent for specific purposes. Performance of a Contract. The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. Legal Obligation. The processing is necessary to comply with the law. Vital Interests. The processing is necessary to protect human lives. Public Task. The processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest. Legitimate Interests . The processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, where those interests do not override the data protection interests, rights, and freedoms of the individuals. Consent, Performance of a Contract, and Legitimate Interests are the three lawful bases that are most appropriate when we process Personal Data: Generally, Consent is the most appropriate lawful bases when: Individuals freely consent to our processing of their Personal Data after being fully informed (e.g., specific purposes, right to easily withdraw at any time). Generally, Performance of Contract is the most appropriate lawful bases when: Our Products and Services are purchased and used, we need to process Personal Data to fulfill our obligations under the written agreements. Generally, Legitimate Interests is the most appropriate lawful bases when: Owing to the nature of our business and the size of our databases, it is impractical for us to contact every individual to obtain his/her consent. The processing we do is unlikely to affect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individuals whose data we process and make available to our Customers and Partners because: Under our Business-to-Business (B2B) model, we only process BCI taken from the public domain (e.g., work e-mail addresses); We provide BCI to help our customers promote their offerings to other businesses (i.e., B2B); It is in the interest of the professionals whose BCI we process for us to maintain accurate information so that businesses can better reach the most relevant business contacts, thus promoting the legitimate interests of the individual and our customers; and You always have the right to opt-out and restrict all further processing of your Personal Data.The controllers of our B2B databases are our subsidiary[ies] Leadiro UK Limited and DS Intelligence LLC.
