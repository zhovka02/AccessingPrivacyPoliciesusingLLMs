Frequently asked questions From where do you collect your Business and Person Information? We collect data from millions of unique commercially and publicly available sources including, state and federal business filings, company websites, job descriptions, job postings, social websites, business directories, and more. Our data collection is an important part of our business IP and strategy, and we typically do not reveal any further details.
This vast quantity of data is then distilled down to high-quality business and business person records at a large scale with high levels of multi-source validation and comprehensive deduplication. No other company is able to combine the number of high-quality input vectors and frequency of data refreshes that NetWise makes available. How accurate is your data? This answer depends largely on your use case and the specific information or data that you need. We maintain strict quality metrics for all our data products and we can answer any specific questions, explicitly, if you contact us directly. We have been providing B2B data to the primary martech/adtech platforms, technology companies, major brands, and advertising agencies for almost a decade. We know our quality meets the needs of almost 100% of customers that test it.
Generically speaking, NetWise employs strict and continuous QA procedures beginning with our data collection, continuing throughout every step of data analysis and processing, and finally before export to our customers and channel partners. This QA process is enhanced by our multi-sourced supply chain, providing many vectors for increased quality and accuracy, and is further backed by both manual oversight and unit testing throughout the production process. How are NetWise’s Digital Advertising Segments created? NetWise generates comprehensive and deterministic B2B segments using current job titles, company firmographics, and other self-declared business-related attributes like skills, education, certifications, etc. This is accomplished by analyzing publicly available information and data created directly by persons in our dataset. These data features are often multi-source validated across our compiled data. Segments are deterministic, based on foundational information and never modeled unless explicitly indicated. All our underlying data is available for your projects, and your segment questions can be answered explicitly if you contact us directly. How fresh and current is your data? Fresh data flows into our business weekly and is promptly tested for quality and consistency before being staged for inclusion into our core systems. Our full production file of persons and businesses is entirely refreshed quarterly with the most current information. Depending on the customer needs and the specific data requested, we can deliver updates as frequently as weekly, with custom segments available on demand. How does NetWise comply with industry standards and regulations? NetWise strives to maintain compliance with all applicable data privacy rules and regulations. We abide by the self-regulating guidelines of the IAB, DMA, NAI and DAA have appointed an internal Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is a licensed attorney in California and runs our compliance division. Our DPO monitors new, dynamic, and upcoming relevant regulations such as the CCPA, and ensures our ongoing compliance with all applicable data privacy rules and regulations.

You can read our 3rd party audit from BPA Worldwide which reviewed our architecture, processes, logic, and security, as well as data sourcing, quality, and accuracy. This report is available upon request. Can you create Custom Advertising Segments? We regularly work with customers to generate and activate custom segments. These can be created in many different ways using our standard production data or using billions of data points that are behind the scenes in our systems, and always ready for analysis.
We are experts at extracting intelligence from our data and making it useful for your specific business need. Contact us to discuss your specific custom audience, campaign, or segment. What regions does your data cover? Our primary focus is data about United States’ businesses and business-persons with a secondary focus on Global information.
