This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect from you when you communicate with us by telephone, chat or SMS or through social media, access and use our website(s) or other platforms or properties (the “Properties”), or otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy also applies to personal information we collect from other sources, including third-party providers of marketing data, public sources, and our parent company Porch.com, Inc., Porch’s parent company and their direct and indirect subsidiaries (each, a “Porch Group Company”). By “personal information,” we mean information that uniquely identifies an individual, such as name, phone number, or email address; unique financial information, such as a credit card number you provide to make a purchase; and information that we link to a unique identifier(s) or unique financial information. If information is de-linked or de-identified, we do not consider it to be personal information. For example, a postal address would not be personal information if it were included in a list of addresses without names or other unique identifiers. Business information (such as the name of a business or the business address or phone number) is not personal information. Our business is business-to-business (B2B), not direct-to-consumer. We provide our clients with marketing data products and services, such as marketing programs, validation of consumer identity, and modeling and analytics, using data that we obtain from publicly available information, surveys, and third-party marketing data providers and other third-party data sources. We include data we receive from third-party sources in the products and services we sell only to the extent that we have the right to sell or share that data under the agreements with the data sources (including, if applicable, the privacy policies of Porch Group Companies). We will not collect data directly from you or other individuals for this purpose, and any person can request that their information be removed from our database for the marketing data products and services that we sell to our clients. See the section below entitled Managing Your Personal Information/ Opting Out of Porch Group Media’s Marketing Data Database . When a person interacts with us, it is usually in their business role (i.e., as a representative of a client or a potential client for our data marketing and analysis products and services). Even in business interactions, however, a person could still provide us with their name and other personal information. When you interact with us, we will collect your personal information and use it to interact with you as described in this Privacy Policy. As noted above, we will not include information that we collect directly from you in our database for the products and services that we sell to our clients. However, if we obtain your personal information from public sources or third-party sources, it may be included in that database unless you opt out. References to Porch Group Media (or “we”) also include companies providing services to Porch Group Media, the Porch Group Companies, and our business partners, to the extent that such parties are collecting, using, or sharing personal information for us or on our behalf. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by those companies only when they provide it to Porch Group Media. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website(s) and updating the effective date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may provide you with additional notice, such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not continue using the Properties or otherwise interacting with us. Information We Collect Information You Give to Us We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, address, contact phone number, and other information when you fill out a registration form, contact our sales teams about our products and services, or otherwise transact business with us; make content submissions or community postings (e.g., chats and comments to our blogs); subscribe to our promotional marketing programs; request customer support; or otherwise provide us with content that includes personal information. If you elect to purchase products or services from us, you will be required to provide payment information, such as a credit card number. Information We Collect Automatically When you access or use the Properties or when we send you emails, we and our advertisers may use tracking technologies to automatically collect information about you.  Please see our Cookie Policy to learn more about these technologies, how we use them, and how to manage or disable them. Automatically collected information may be associated with a unique browser, device identifier, or Internet protocol (IP) address, but we do not consider it to be personal information unless it is linked to your unique identifier(s). When you receive emails from us, we collect information about whether and when you opened the email, whether you clicked on the images and links in the email, and whether your computer or mobile device is capable of receiving HTML-based email. Information Collected from Calls When you call us or when we call you, we may monitor, record and transcribe those calls for quality assurance, customer satisfaction and analysis purposes. In those jurisdictions where consent is required for a party to record a telephone call, you consent to us recording such calls. We treat the records of these calls, when linked to your unique identifier(s), as personal information. Information We Collect from Third Parties Porch Group Media obtains personal information from third-party marketing data providers, surveys, and sources of publicly available information. The Porch Group Companies provide us with information they collect from their customers and business partners. For example, if you utilize the services of another Porch Group Company, that company may provide your information to us to help keep our databases updated and, to the extent that they are permitted to share information with us for this purpose, to provide our clients with better products and services. We may combine personal information we have about a consumer (for example, an email address) with information obtained from other sources (such as name, telephone number, and mailing address), in accordance with applicable law. Aggregate and Anonymized Information We may also aggregate (group) or de-link/de-identify (anonymize) information. Aggregated, anonymized data is not personal information subject to this Privacy Policy, and we may use it for any purpose. We may also share aggregated and/or anonymized information with third parties.

We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collect for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice. How We Share Information We share personal information as follows: Clients We sell, rent and otherwise share personal information to our clients (which may include Porch Group Companies and companies operating in the ad tech sector) to be used for their own commercial purposes as part of our marketing data products and services, when we are legally and contractually permitted to do so (for example, if the collected information is publicly available or we are permitted to sell or share it under the applicable agreements with the data sources). Porch Group Companies We share personal information with Porch Group Companies for marketing purposes and for the purpose of improving their products and services (such as confirming or supplementing information they have about a person or to classify a person as a mover), when we are legally and contractually permitted to do so. We also share personal information with the Porch Group Companies in connection with the data, technical, legal, accounting, and other services shared between the Porch Group Companies and for other internal business purposes. The Porch Group Companies who receive personal information from Porch Group Media will be bound by the legal terms applicable to the shared information (e.g., the contract with our data source) and, unless they are purchasing the data as a Porch Group Media client, will use that personal information only as described in this Privacy Policy. Companies Providing Services to Porch Group Media We share information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers that are providing business services to Porch Group Media. For instance, we may share information with a third-party service provider that hosts the Properties, processes payments, provides customer service, sends out emails, serves ads on the Properties or on a third-party platform, or monitors or analyzes data. Such companies will have access to personal information only as necessary to carry out their work and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. Companies with Whom a Person Has an Existing Relationship If a person is already a customer of or otherwise has a direct relationship with a business partner of Porch Group Media or a Porch Group Company (an “Existing Relationship Company”), we or the Porch Group Company may disclose certain information about that person to that Existing Relationship Company. If that person is a match to a customer on the Existing Relationship Company customer list, we may provide the Existing Relationship Company with information such as the groups or segments he or she belongs to (such as mover or homeowner) and demographic information about the person and his or her home (such as estimated household income and square footage), so that the Existing Relationship Company can provide him or her with more relevant advertising, products and services. We will not give the Existing Relationship Company any contact information, unique personal identifiers, or unique financial information unless for another purpose permitted in this Privacy Policy. However, the Existing Relationship Company may already have some or all of that information (because of its existing relationship with the person) and they will be able to link the person with the other information about him or her that we provide to them. Compliance with Laws and Policies; Protection of Rights We may disclose personal information if we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or legal process, to cooperate with government or law enforcement, or to avoid legal liability; to resolve complaints or disputes; to investigate and resolve technical issues, security incidents, fraud, abuse, and illegal activities; if we believe a user’s actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies; or to protect the rights, reputation, safety and property of Porch Group Media or others. Strategic Transactions We may disclose personal information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business or in a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction.
