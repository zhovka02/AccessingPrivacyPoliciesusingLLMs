How We Share Data with Third Parties Wodwo may share the Information with customers, marketing services and platforms, and service providers that we retain, in order to provide the Services we have described above (or other services we may add) and as described below. This includes the below sharing: Partners: We may share the Information, including personally identifiable information and Audience Segments, with business and data partners to help provide more tailored targeted marketing, advertising and communications. Likewise, we may do so for analytical purposes, including to help these other parties measure campaign performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze, or segregate this Information on our or our customers’ behalf. Customers: We license the Information in various ways to our customers (and sometimes to partners and resellers, who license the Information to their customers), when we provide our Services. Service Providers: We share the Information with a variety of service providers in order to operate, protect and advertise our Services and maintain our website.  For instance, we share the Information with tech and customer support providers, marketing and advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance or verify our Information), security vendors, payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies help us deliver or develop Services. Corporate transfers: If Wodwo, its stock or its significant assets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our information will be transferred to that entity. Affiliates, parent companies and subsidiaries: Wodwo may share some or all of the Information in our possession with any affiliated or subsidiary companies (if we ever have any). As Required by Law or to Protect Any Party: Wodwo may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Wodwo, our customers, or any other party. Your Opt-Out Choices There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you: First, you may contact us directly at privacyofficer@Wodwo.co in order to have your name removed from our database.  When you do this, please provide your current address, your email address, and any prior home or email addresses you would like “opted out” of our marketing databases.  Or if you prefer, you can contact us directly by mail, at: Wodwo, Inc. Attn: Opt-out 506 Carnegie Center Drive, Suite 105 Princeton, NJ 08540 Email: privacyofficer@Wodwo.co If you would like to opt-out of direct mail advertising in general, we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at thedma.org . The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow a few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads, addition, you can also visit the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages. Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike Wodwo’s direct opt-out). Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.  Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you. If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – such as to communicate about new services or to invite you to events – you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails. Cookies and Similar Technologies Cookies and How We Use Them Wodwo and its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functional technologies, which we describe below. We may work with third parties to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form. These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies. Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a  unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device. When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see. Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests. Disabling Cookies Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our website and other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable.

We may combine the Information with other information we obtain from third parties, publicly available sources, and any other product or service we provide to further improve the relevance and effectiveness of products, and advertisements offered, including (but not limited to), those provided on or through our services. We may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our website(s). We also may use IP addresses to help identify visitors to our website(s) for the duration of a session and to gather demographic information about our visitors. We may use clickstream data to determine how much time visitors spend on each web page of our website(s), how visitors navigate through the website(s), and how we may tailor our website(s) to better meet the needs of our visitors. We also use the information for compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures, including the enforcement of our Terms and Conditions. If we collect information from “offline” sources – such as if you provide us your business card at a trade show – we will maintain that information and use it for marketing and business purposes, as well.

OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING AND SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION Generally speaking, we collect and share the Personal Information that we collect for the following purposes, as we also have described in our Privacy Policy: Our Purposes for collecting, using and sharing Personal Information Data marketing services, for example: Providing marketing information to our Clients (which may include companies, non-profit organizations, other data compilers, resellers and platforms, advertising networks, and political organizations), generally regarding their marketing, fundraising, customer service and engagement, and outreach activities. Helping our Clients identify and understand their consumers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs, as well as providing financial and other scoring products.

Additional marketing services, for example: Assisting in targeting and optimizing direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing. Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases. Analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud.

Operating our Services, for example: Improving, testing, updating and verifying our own database. Developing new products. Operating, analyzing, improving, and securing our Services. Other internal purposes, for example: For internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance.  We sometimes use the information collected from our own website from social networks, from other “business to business” interaction (such as at trade shows) or from data compilers for the above, as well as for our own marketing purposes. 4. YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS AND CHOICES Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.  This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.  (To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)   Please note that sometimes we act as a “service provider” for our clients, in which case we receive and act on instructions from the client(s) as to the client data provided:  any requests to exercise rights with respect to data we handle on behalf of a client should be directed to the particular client. a. Right to request access to your personal information California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information. b. Right to request deletion of your personal information California residents may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you, such as if you have been a customer of ours. (Note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described below; also note that we do not generally collect personal information directly from consumers.) However, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services. c. Right to “opt-out” of the sale of your personal information. California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines what constitutes a “sale” – including making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration.” Depending what information we have about you, and whether we have included any of it in our marketing products and services, we may have sold (as defined by California law) certain categories of information about you in the last 12 months, as described in the above table in Section 2 of this Addendum. If you would like to opt out, you may do so as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information d. How to exercise your access and (if applicable) deletion rights California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by sending an email to privacy.officer@Wodwo.co and by submitting your request to our Privacy Portal . You may submit a right to access request by contacting our toll-free number at 888-990-3399. However, we recommend that you access our Privacy Portal, as you may find it to be more efficient, and as we have tried to provide clear and comprehensive information on those web pages. For security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as your possession of an email address or your residence at a home address in order to confirm you are the person you claim to be. Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate: Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories. Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern to doing so. Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out” or a “deletion”:  because “opt out” or “do not sell” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes – i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future (which is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur) — we try to explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences.  (In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information that we have collected “from” consumers – which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.) Upon completion of the above process, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information we were able to locate about you, whether we (1) deleted, (2) deidentified, or (3) retained the information we collected from you.  Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request. e. Right to nondiscrimination. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights. f. Information about persons under 16 years of age We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so. If we learn that personal information from such California residents has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent). g. Authorized agents You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above. Where permitted or required by law, we will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.
