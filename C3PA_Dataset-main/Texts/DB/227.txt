Back to Top Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixel Tags, and GIFs What are Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and GIFs and how are they used? A cookie is a small text file (which typically includes a piece of computer code) that is stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are sent by our website (or the website of a company we have a relationship with) to your computer, mobile phone or other device when you visit our website. When you visit a website, that website's computer asks your computer for permission to store this text file in a section of your hard drive that is specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. A Web beacon is a graphic image, such as a pixel tag or clear GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity, such as whether the Web page or e-mail message is accessed or clicked. They are also used on many Web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our website or to gather statistics about browser usage on our website. Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. Web beacons may also be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page. Some of our e-mails may also contain pixels or code to gather information regarding e-mail behavior and for analytics. We may share this information with third parties Back to Top Cookie Uses We use cookies to store login and other information on your computer, which serves to improve our website functionality and tailor our services to your preferences and interests.

Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and to assess which parts of the site are most popular. This information helps us to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers. Some of our cookies may be tied to personally identifiable information, such as IP address. We do not store credit/debit card numbers in cookies. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website. For more information about the type of information that is collected on website visitors, see our Privacy Policy section on “What Information We collect” Back to Top Types of Cookies Some cookies are necessary to make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website.

Persistent cookies are stored on your device to help remember information, settings, preferences, or sign-on credentials and have an expiration date issued by the webserver. Session cookies, also known as in-memory cookies, transient cookies, or non-persistent cookies, exist only in temporary memory while you are browsing the website and are typically deleted when you close your browser. Preference cookies are persistent cookies which enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in.

Third Party Cookies Some of our business partners, such as third-party advertisers, use cookies that originate from their websites. The third parties with whom we partner provide certain features on our site to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity. In the course of serving advertisements, our third-party advertisers and partners may place or recognize a unique third-party cookie on your browser.

The use of third-party cookies and other tracking technologies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over any third-party tracking technologies. Third party advertisers may also use a third-party analytics provider to place third party cookies on your browser to collect anonymous and aggregated session data, such as the ads that are viewed. If you view a Web page where our ads appear, the advertising company may place a cookie on your computer or use a Web beacon to access a cookie that they previously placed on your computer. These companies do not collect information that can personally identify you, but they may use information about your visits to our website and other websites to measure the effectiveness of ads. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to these companies. We share aggregate website usage information with third party advertisers and partners for the purpose of effectively targeting our online advertisements. Unless you are previously notified, these advertising companies do not link any online behavior or cookies with other information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, when working with Dun & Bradstreet. These third-party advertising networks also track visitors' online usage and behavior patterns. These companies may use information about your visits to Dun & Bradstreet and other websites to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The result of these efforts is the creation of an online profile that attempts to predict individual user interests, preferences and purchasing habits. The third-party advertising networks then accordingly customize the advertising content served to users when visiting other websites.
