This Policy does not describe processing of your personal information in connection with our Marketing and Advertising Services or our Identity Services. Our Marketing and Advertising Services support our customers’ interest-based advertising activities and efforts to monetize digital advertising inventory. Read our Marketing and Advertising Services Privacy Policy for more information. Our Identity Services help our customers engage with you across devices as you browse the internet, use mobile applications, or otherwise interact with our Customers. Read our Identity Services Privacy Policy for more information. “Personal Information” is information that identifies or can reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an identifiable individual. Information that is anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated is not “personal information” within the meaning of this Policy. What information do we collect? We collect information about you from a variety of sources, including from you. You might provide your information directly to us, such as when you register for an account on the Sites or for one of our events. We may also collect your information automatically, such as when you browse our Sites or otherwise interact with our Offerings. We might further collect your information from other third-party sources. Information You Provide We and our service providers collect identifiers and any other information that you provide when you interact with our Offerings. For example, when filling out forms online or at an event, you may choose to provide your name, email address, and phone number. We collect the following categories of personal information directly from you: Identifiers: You may provide identifiers such as your name, email address, and phone number when you interact with the Offerings, such as when you register for an event or create an account on our Sites. Professional information: You may provide information about your employer and job title, such as when registering for an event. Geolocation information: You may provide information about where you reside or are located, such as your ZIP code, city, state, or country. Information Automatically Collected from You When you use the Sites, we and our service partners may automatically collect certain information from you, including the following categories of personal information: Identifiers and Device Information: We may collect identifiers from you, such as your IP address and unique digital identifiers (such as mobile advertising IDs). We may also collect information related to the devices you use to access the Offerings, such as the device type, operating system, and version. Network Activity Information: We may collect information related to your activity on our Sites, such as time spent on the Sites, from which website you came, and to which website you exit. Demographic and Profile Information: We may collect demographic and other profile information about you, such as your age and gender. Geolocation Information: We may collect and process information about your general location, such as the zip code you’re in, your city, state, and country. Inferences: We may use the information we collect to generate certain inferences, such as buying preferences. To collect the information described above, we and our service providers may use cookies, which are small text files that online services often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer or mobile device returns to a website that it has visited previously. The Sites also may contain small, transparent images, files, or lines of code that collect information about how you interact with the pages, emails, advertisements, and apps. For example, these technologies may collect information about the web pages you visit, the content you view, when and for how long you interact with certain features, and whether you respond to advertisements. We may use these technologies to identify your computer or device (which can help us or our service providers recognize you when you return), store information about your preferences (e.g., preferred language), log your interactions (e.g., the types of messages you prefer to receive), and present you with more relevant interest-based advertisements. We retain this information in a form that can identify your computer or device for up to 180 days. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals. Information from Other Sources We also collect information from third-party sources, including business contact databases, data aggregators, and publicly-available sources and records. We collect the following categories of personal information from these sources: Identifiers and Device Information: We may collect identifiers of yours, such as your e-mail address and telephone number. Demographic and Profile Information: We may collect information such as your age, gender, and annual income. Inferences: We may collect inferences about you, including your buying preferences. How do we use the information we collect? We and our service providers may use the information we collect to: deliver personalized messages that match your interests, including interest-based advertisements; understand the interests of our users; customize your experience when using our Offerings; generate and analyze statistics about the performance of our advertising campaigns, and to improve performance over time; provide and improve the Offerings, and to develop new Offerings; communicate with you, such as by providing newsletters or other advertisements, and to respond to your inquiries; when we believe in good faith that use is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of our Services, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of terms of use related to the Service, or violations of law; and fulfill the purposes described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. We may combine, de-identify, or aggregate any of the information we collect in relation to the Offerings for any of these purposes. Certain jurisdictions, including the European Union, have laws that require us to have a “legal basis” to process your personal information. Where required by applicable law, we rely on one of the following legal bases to justify our processing of your personal information: to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, for example to provide access to Sites that you request and to ensure that invoices are delivered or paid correctly. Failure to provide personal information necessary to perform a contract may prevent or delay the fulfilment of our contractual obligations; to comply with our legal obligations, for example to respond to legally binding requests from regulators, law enforcement authorities, or other government authorities; to meet our legitimate interests, for example to understand how you use the Sites and to enable us to derive knowledge that enables us to develop new Offerings. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place safeguards to protect your privacy and to determine that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; and to exercise our legal rights where it is necessary to do so, for example to detect, prevent and respond to fraud claims, intellectual property infringement claims, or other violations of law. We may obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of personal information when we are required to do so by law. If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw, where permitted by law, your consent contacting us using the details at the end of this Privacy Policy. With whom do we share information we collect? We do not share your personal information with third parties without your consent except we may share the categories of information noted above: with our service providers for the business purposes described in this Privacy Policy; with our business partners with whom we provide co-branded materials or events that you elect to receive or participate in, such as webinars, white papers, events, or case studies, for their marketing purposes; as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to comply with government reporting obligations; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of the Website, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Website; and to affiliates, service providers, advisors, and other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each website you visit. International Transfers of Personal Information We may transfer, process, and store personal information outside of your home country, including in the United States and Canada, which may not have the same level of data protection as your home country. If you are resident in the European Economic Area ("EEA") this may include the transfer of your personal information from within the EEA to a country outside of the EEA. Where required, we have implemented appropriate safeguards for such transfers. For more information on the safeguards we use, please contact privacy@liveintent.com . Security We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information we collect. However, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Modifications to this policy We may update this Policy from time to time by posting an updated Policy on this page. We will notify you about material changes by updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Policy or by providing any other notice or mechanism as may be appropriate.

Our EU representative is Phillip Markert, who can be reached at euprivacy@liveintent.com . California Disclosures California law requires that businesses such as LiveIntent describe certain transfers of information that involve the exchange of money or other valuable consideration. California defines such transfers as “sales,” even if money never trades hands. With respect to our Offerings, we may disclose the following categories of your information in a manner that California may consider to be “sales”: Identifiers and Device Information Demographic and Profile Information Network Activity Information Geolocation Information Inferences California residents may exercise their rights to learn about our processing of personal information (including learning about the specific pieces of information we collect) or request deletion of personal information by visiting this webform or by emailing us at ccpacompliance@liveintent.com , or by calling us at 855-655-0542 . We will not deny you services for exercising your rights, though we may still provide a different level of service. We may verify California residents’ identities before fulfilling requests to learn about our processing of personal information (including learning about the specific pieces of information we collect) and requests regarding the deletion of personal information by matching information provided by the California resident to the personal information that we already have for that individual. Consumers will need to provide their email addresses and may also be sent a unique token by LiveIntent to support identity verification when applicable. California residents also have the right to opt-out of the “sale” (as described above) of their information. You can exercise that right by emailing us at ccpacompliance@liveintent.com or clicking here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information . We may transfer your information even if you opt out of sales if such transfers do not constitute “sales” under California law. We will ask requestors seeking to opt-out of “sales” to provide their email addresses and may seek additional information to confirm their California residency. The email address helps us locate relevant records in our databases. When submitting these requests via our online privacy portal, we then send a unique token to the email address to prevent fraudulent opt-out requests from being submitted. Authorized agents of California residents may submit requests by emailing us at ccpacompliance@liveintent.com . Authorized agents will need to provide documentation proving that they are authorized to exercise rights on behalf of the consumer whose personal information is subject to the request. We may notify the consumer and require the consumer to independently verify their identity before fulfilling the authorized agent’s request.
