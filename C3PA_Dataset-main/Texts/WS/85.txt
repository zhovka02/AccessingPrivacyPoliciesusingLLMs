To learn more about the GPC and how you can use it to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information you can visit their website here . If you visit our website with a browser transmitting GPC, we will not share for targeted advertising or sell your personal information associated with your visit.

And if we recognize you on subsequent visits, including when you use other devices or browsers to log in to your account, we will respect your opt-out preference until you change it.

If you submit an email address with your access, delete, or correct request, we will send an email to you, asking that you confirm that we have the correct email address within six (6) days of receiving the confirmation email or your request will expire. If you do not see an email from us, please check your spam folder. There may be circumstances where we may not completely fulfill your request, as permitted under applicable law. For example, if you submit a request to delete your personal information, we may need to retain certain personal information to complete a transaction, detect fraud, or comply with our legal obligations.
