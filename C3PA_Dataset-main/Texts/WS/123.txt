AUTOZONE REWARDS PROGRAM ("Program")                                 Terms and Conditions Updated: 10/4/2023 Participants ("Members") in the AutoZone Rewards Program                                 (“Program”) are subject to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”). By                                 accessing and participating in the Program, Members accept and agree to be bound by the                                 Terms and Conditions, which are a contract and are subject to change from time to time                                 without notice to Members, as well as AutoZone's Privacy                                     Policy . Members should read these Terms and Conditions carefully. This contract                                 requires Members to release all claims against AutoZone. By participating in the                                 Program, Members are agreeing to mandatory, binding arbitration with no class relief,                                 and to a limitation of their rights and remedies, including any damages that may be                                 recovered. Program membership (“Membership”) is open to all U.S., Puerto Rico                                 and U.S. Virgin Islands residents (excluding all U.S. territories other than Puerto Rico                                 and the U.S. Virgin Islands) who are at least 18 years old or, if older, the age of                                 majority in the Member's jurisdiction of residence. A copy of these Terms and Conditions                                 is available at each participating store or from the Program website ( www.AutoZone.com/Rewards ). 1.                                     Membership: a. Customers of AutoZone may only enroll in the Program by (a)                                 completing the application process at participating AutoZone locations; or (b) signing                                 up online at the Program website ( www.AutoZone.com/Rewards ). Once                                 enrolled, eligible customers will receive a membership ID (“AutoZone Rewards ID”) to be                                 used when making all purchases. Once registered, the AutoZone Rewards ID can be found on                                 the registration receipt, Member's weekly emails, the AutoZone mobile app, or by logging                                 into the Program online. Alternatively, Members may use the phone number associated with                                 their Program account when making purchases in-store. b. Members must provide the                                 required information to be enrolled and to be eligible for Rewards (defined below). c.                                 AutoZone commercial accounts are not eligible to participate in the Program. d. AutoZone                                 reserves the right to limit the number of Members in the Program. e. AutoZone reserves                                 the right, in its sole discretion and without notice, to expire a Member's enrollment in                                 the Program after twelve (12) months of Program account inactivity. All accrued credits                                 and Rewards will be lost if the Membership expires or is cancelled. 2.                                     Transaction-Based Program: a. The AutoZone Rewards ID, or phone number if in-store, must be                                 provided by the Member at the time of purchase. Prior purchases are not eligible, except                                 in limited circumstances set forth in Section 2.IV. below. b. Except as set forth in the                                 Pilot Terms (as defined below), for each in-store transaction, online transaction and                                 buy online, pick up in store ("BOPUS") transaction of $20 or more, excluding federal,                                 state, and local taxes, shipping charges, product and employee discounts (i.e. credit is                                 awarded based on total after application of discount), commercial account purchases,                                 charitable donations, core deposits, Loan-a-Tool® deposits, loaner battery deposits,                                 environmental fees, returns, refunds, purchases of gift cards, and items purchased with                                 any Rewards or other awards ("qualifying purchases"), Member will receive one (1) credit                                 (a "credit"). AutoZone may also, without prior notice and at its sole discretion,                                 provide additional bonus credits from time to time in connection with certain                                 transactions and/or promotions. When a Member has earned 5 credits, the Member will                                 automatically receive a Reward of one (1) $20 merchandise credit ("20 Reward Dollars")                                 to be used at participating AutoZone stores and online. AutoZone may also, from time to                                 time, at its sole discretion, provide additional Bonus Rewards in connection with                                 certain transactions and/or promotions ("Bonus Rewards"). Bonus Rewards and 20 Reward                                 Dollars are referred to collectively as "Rewards". Rewards and credits will be assigned                                 to the Participant's AutoZone Rewards ID and may be accessed through the Member's                                 Program Account. Credits will expire three hundred and sixty-five (365) days after                                 issuance, and Rewards will expire ninety (90) days after issuance; provided, that the                                 foregoing expiration rules do not apply to Members who enrolled in the Program in the                                 state of Maine. Rewards and credits may not be immediately available for use. AutoZone                                 reserves the right to terminate or modify the Program, in full or in part, and at any                                 AutoZone store or stores, at any time, in its sole discretion without prior notice to                                 Member. c. During a single in-store visit, Member may not separate qualifying purchases                                 into multiple transactions for the purpose of earning more credits than would be                                 available through a single in-store transaction. d. The appropriate number of credits                                 will be automatically deducted from the Member's account balance for every Reward that                                 is automatically redeemed by AutoZone on the Member's behalf in accordance with the                                 terms of the Program. e. Credits from multiple accounts may not be aggregated unless                                 authorized by AutoZone in its sole discretion. f. Unredeemed credits and Rewards                                 remaining in a Member's account will expire at the termination of the Program or at the                                 sole discretion of AutoZone, whichever occurs first. g. The appropriate credit(s) and/or                                 Reward(s) will be automatically deducted from the Member's account balance if items                                 returned or refunded from a qualifying purchase cause the qualifying purchase to fall                                 below the qualifying threshold to earn a credit, as determined under these Terms and                                 Conditions. ***Special Terms for Pilot Regions: Effective as of January 22, 2024,                                     Members who fall into one of the following three categories based on their purchase                                     history over the last 36 months will be subject to the “Pilot Terms”, as more fully                                     set forth below. 1.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AutoZone's failure                                 to exercise any of its rights under these Program Rules or its delay in enforcing or                                 exercising any of those rights shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. j.

Sponsor's failure to enforce any                                 of these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other                                 provision in these Terms and Conditions. You agree that whenever you have a                                 claim, dispute or disagreement with Sponsor arising out of or in any way related to the                                 Program, the Terms and Conditions, or the Privacy Policy, you will send a written notice                                 to the Sponsor describing the nature of such claim, dispute or disagreement (“Demand”).                                 You agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section 5 will apply even to                                 matters that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms and Conditions or the                                 Privacy Policy. You must send the Demand to the following address (the “Notice                                 Address”): AutoZone.com, Inc., 123 S. Front St., Memphis, TN 38103, Attention; Legal                                 Department. You agree that You will not take any legal action, including filing a                                 lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until 10 business days after You send a Demand. This                                 informal dispute resolution is in addition to, and does not waive, excuse, or supersede                                 any pre-suit resolution process required by state or federal law before filing                                 suit. If the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your                                 satisfaction within 10 business days after it is received, and You intend on taking                                 legal action, you agrees that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American                                 Arbitration Association (“AAA” or the “Arbitrator”). Sponsor agrees that it will submit                                 any and all disputes with You to arbitration before the Arbitrator. This arbitration                                 provision limits your ability and the ability of Sponsor to litigate claims in court and                                 you and Sponsor each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial. For                                 any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must provide proper service under the                                 rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient. If, for                                 any reason, the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with                                 any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer                                 Arbitration Rules effective September 1, 2014, available at https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf (and as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute                                 Resolution section. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive                                 jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Program or any                                 disputes with the Program's Sponsor including, but not limited to, disputes as to the                                 interpretation or application of this Dispute Resolution section or the validity of the                                 arbitration agreement herein. The Arbitrator has authority to issue any and all remedies                                 authorized by law, except that any requests for the remedy of public injunctive relief                                 shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act                                 allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and                                 enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate. The place of arbitration shall be Shelby                                 County, Tennessee. You agree that you will not file a class action or collective                                 action against AutoZone, and that you will not participate in a class action or                                 collective action against AutoZone. You agree that you will not join its claims to those                                 of any other person. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Terms and                                 Conditions, Pilot Terms, or the Privacy Policy, if this class action waiver is                                 adjudicated to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the agreement to                                 arbitrate is  and void, as though it were never entered into, and any arbitration                                 dispute at that time will be dismissed without prejudice and may be refiled in court.                                 Followers irrevocably consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state or                                 federal courts of the State of Tennessee located in Shelby County for any action, suit                                 or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Program. Under no circumstances will you                                 or AutoZone agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of                                 claims in arbitration. The provisions of this Dispute Resolution section shall                                 survive conclusion, modification or termination of the Program and suspension,                                 revocation, closure, modification, or amendments to the Program terms, and any aspect of                                 the relationship of the parties relating to or arising from participation in the                                 Program. 6.                                     Termination: The Program has no predetermined termination date and may continue until such time as AutoZone, at its sole discretion, elects to designate a program termination date. Members may cancel participation in the Program and/or request not to be contacted via mail by notifying the Program Administrator at AutoZone Rewards, 123 S. Front Street, Memphis, TN 38103, via email to CustomerCare@AutoZoneRewards.com, or via Customer Service at 1-800-741-9179. 7.

AutoZone is not responsible for and does not control the security or privacy                                             of those sites.

We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of                                             16. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has                                             violated this Privacy Policy and provided us with Personal Information,                                             please contact us.

Updates to this Privacy Policy From time to time, AutoZone may modify this Privacy Policy. AutoZone will                                             notify you of any material changes to its Privacy Policy by posting those                                             changes on this page and updating the Privacy Policy modification date                                             above. AutoZone encourages you periodically to check back to this page for                                             any updates. Submitting a Verifiable Data Subject                                     Request to AutoZone As mentioned above, certain state residents have certain rights to access,                                             delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their                                             information. AutoZone will respond to an individual's “verifiable request”                                             to exercise his or her rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has                                             received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and                                             AutoZone has been able to verify the individual's identity. The need to                                             verify an individual's identity is critical to protecting your information                                             and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to                                             be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf. You may submit a verifiable request via our website or toll-free number                                             listed in the “Exercising Your State Law Privacy Rights” section below or as                                             otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available).                                             AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can                                             verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include                                             your name, your address, your account information, and any other information                                             deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure                                             that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we                                             have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a                                             timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are                                             unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information                                             about you within your systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a                                             deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is                                             necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will                                             inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request. We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your                                             identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in                                             those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity. Under California law a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make                                             certain verifiable requests upon their behalf, such as the right to know                                             what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the                                             consumer's information. Because the security and privacy of your information                                             is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in                                             writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your                                             applicable rights under California law in such situations. This may require                                             us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to                                             be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We                                             will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized                                             person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without                                             authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other                                             requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in                                             writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where                                             we cannot independently verify your identity.

WARRANTIES When you purchase a part - online or at one of                                         AutoZone's retail stores - covered by AutoZone warranty, your warranty                                         information is automatically entered into AutoZone's national warranty                                         database. If you need to return a part under warranty, please take it to any                                         AutoZone store. To learn more about specific warranties, select one                                         of the links below: AutoZone's Limited Warranty If a part fails during the warranty period shown on your                                         receipt, bring the part to an AutoZone store and you will receive a replacement                                         or refund. Warranty excludes damage caused by misuse, abuse, other faulty parts,                                         improper installation or off-road, commercial or marine use. Warranties on                                         replacement parts cover the unused portion of the original warranty or 90 days,                                         whichever is longer. Warranties expire when you sell your vehicle. This                                         limited warranty represents the total liability of AutoZone, for any part or                                         product. AutoZone makes no other warranties, express or implied, including the                                         implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.                                         AutoZone shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or                                         consequential damages. Some states do not allow limitations on how long                                         an implied warranty lasts, or exclusion or limitation on incidental or                                         consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. This                                         warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights                                         which vary from state to state.

Core Return Policy What is a core? When a vehicle is repaired, the                                         old or failed part that was replaced is called a core. These cores are then                                         remanufactured (recycled) by companies to original equipment specifications.                                         Remanufacturing is the process of taking used parts, completely disassembling                                         and thoroughly cleaning them, replacing the faulty and/or worn components with                                         original quality components, and restoring them to their original function. The                                         testing and procedures are the same as the original equipment                                         manufacturers. Your shipment or other return of any core or other product                                         to AutoZone or AutoZone.com is considered a transfer of ownership, and AutoZone                                         will be unable to return the core or other product to you. Core Return to an AutoZone                                         store To return a core to an AutoZone store, simply take the                                     product, in its original packaging and/or box, to the store of your choice along                                     with your receipt. You must drain all fluids, if any, from the product before                                     returning it.* AutoZone recommends that you take the credit card used to                                     purchase the new product so the store can credit your card for the value of the                                     core, assuming the core passes inspection. If you do not have the credit card, or                                     you purchased the product with PayPal or another payment method, simply present your                                     receipt, and upon the core passing the inspection, the store will reimburse your                                     account for the value of the returned core. If the core does not pass                                     inspection, you will not be reimbursed for it and the core will be returned to you. Core Return by                                         Mail To return a core to AutoZone by mail, first drain all fluids,                                     if any, from the product.* Then fill out the Return Form (found in Section B of your                                     Shipping Invoice) and include it along with the core in the original packaging                                     and/or box in which it was received. To mail the core, simply place the                                     return shipping label on the outside of the box and drop off the package at a                                     shipping facility of your choice. You are responsible for verifying and complying                                     with proper shipping requirements of your selected carrier. Please note when                                     returning a core, you will not be reimbursed for shipping costs incurred in shipping                                     the core to AutoZone. Assuming the core passes inspection, the credit card                                     you used to purchase the new product will be credited in the amount of the core's                                     value as indicated by the inspection. If you do not have the credit card, or you                                     purchased with PayPal or another payment method, simply enclose a copy of your                                     receipt and the product, and AutoZone will credit your account in the amount of the                                     value of the core. If the core does not pass inspection, you will not be reimbursed                                     for it. *Please recycle or properly dispose of fluids drained from the                                     returned part. The parts must be free of all flammable and hazardous fluids before                                     shipment. Many AutoZone stores have a free recycling program.
