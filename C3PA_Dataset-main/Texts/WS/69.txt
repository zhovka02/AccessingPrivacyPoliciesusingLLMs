WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? Oracle Corporation and Oracle America, Inc., having their registered address at 2300 Oracle Way,
Austin, TX, 78741, USA, are responsible for processing your personal information in scope of this Privacy
Policy. 4. WHICH CATEGORIES AND SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS? Information about you may in some cases directly identify you, while in other cases it may only indirectly
identify you. Personal information that is collected offline and that can directly identify you may include, for example: name, physical address, email addresses, and telephone numbers; demographic attributes, when tied to other information that identifies you; transactional data based on your purchases, when tied to other information that identifies you; company data such as the name, size, and location of the company you work for and your role within the

Personal information that is collected online and that may indirectly identify you may include, for example: unique IDs such as your mobile device identifier, or a cookie ID on your browser; a connected device identifier such as an ID from a smart or connected television or streaming device (US only); Addressable media identifiers (“AMI”) or other partner- or industry-specific identifiers; IP addresses and information derived from IP addresses, such as geographic location; information about your device, such as browser, device type, operating system, the presence or use of
“apps”, screen resolution, or the preferred language; obfuscated personal information such as hashed email addresses (direct identifiers are removed); demographic information such as gender, age, and income range when not tied to information that directly
identifies you; behavioral data of the internet connected computer or device you use when interacting with websites,
applications, or other connected devices, such as advertisements clicked or viewed, websites and content
areas, date and time of these activities, or the web search used to locate and navigate to a website. We may associate personal information about you with interest segments or profiles as part of the provision
of Oracle Advertising services to our customers and partners: Interest Segments are a specific group of consumers that share a common behavior or
preference used for direct marketing by our customers. For example: in market for travel specials to
Hawaii. Profiles are a set of attributes about a specific consumer or device, or a set of
multiple consumers or devices sharing common attributes used for marketing by our customers. For
example: age bracket 25-55; adventurous traveler; surfing enthusiast; in market for travel specials to
Hawaii. 5. FOR WHAT COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS PURPOSE DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? We use personal information for the following commercial purposes: a) to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to market products and services to you based on your interests; b) to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and
services; We use personal information for the following business purposes: c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems; d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business. These purposes are described below in further detail. a) For personal information collected from individuals located outside the EU/EEA/UK and Switzerland only: to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to market products and services to you based on your interests We process personal information about you for marketing purposes to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to advertise products and services to you via online and offline marketing activities based on your interests. “Marketing purposes” means the processing of offline and online personal information, as
defined in Section 4: (i) to solicit or induce a purchase, rental, lease, or exchange of products or
services directly to consumers or businesses via offline and online advertising campaigns; (ii) to develop
market research or market surveys or to provide verification services to marketers; (iii) to create,
communicate, deliver, and exchange offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society
at large; or (iv) to encourage safe practices and trends and the provision of factual information,
including, by way of example, providing product or automotive recall notices. More specifically, Oracle can process information about you: i. For online interest-based advertising delivered through Oracle Advertising partners that display
online advertising to you on behalf of Oracle Advertising customers. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to market the company’s travel
specials to Hawaii to a specific group of individuals (also known as an audience ) that
may be interested in those specials. The marketing professional uses Oracle Advertising services to
create an audience interested in travel to Hawaii. If you have visited a travel website previously and
have expressed an interest in Hawaiian vacations, you may be placed in the travel company’s audience and
subsequently see advertisements for a vacation to Hawaii on other websites (because a cookie has been
placed on your browser) or, in the United States, via a connected device (due to an association between
your IP address and device identifier). ii. For offline and online campaign measurement, analytics, and development of insights on behalf of our
Oracle Advertising customers. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to better understand if the
company’s marketing campaign for travel specials to Hawaii contributed to an increase in their product
sales. The marketing professional uses Oracle Advertising services to see how many display or videos ads
were viewed, and whether the ads were clicked on and a purchase was made. iii. For enabling our Oracle Advertising customers to personalize their products and services, including
site optimization, email personalization, and dynamic marketing and advertising optimization. Example: if you have previously indicated an interest in travel to Hawaii, when you visit a travel
company’s website it can display tailored offers for Hawaiian vacations on their homepage. iv. For linking Profiles and Interest Segments to enable Oracle Advertising customers and partners to
connect your Interest Segments across the various browsers and/or devices you may use for the purposes
described in this section. Example: you are interested in vacations offered by a travel company and have clicked on their online
advertising. You are logged into several devices (your desktop, smartphone, and tablet) using the same
login. Oracle Advertising partners have indicated that you are likely the same user across those same
devices. The travel company is able to display vacation offers to you (via a de-identified cookie ID) on
these different devices. v. For creating modelled online and offline “lookalike” audiences for Oracle Advertising customers’
products and services. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to find new potential customers who
are, like you, likely to be interested in travel to Hawaii. Oracle Advertising services can help the
travel company by looking for key characteristics between Profiles that have expressed an interest in
traveling to Hawaii and other Profiles where a similar interest can be inferred based on these
characteristics, such as an interest in travel to tropical islands. vi. For enabling our Oracle Advertising customers to associate first-party information to certain Oracle
Advertising identifiers in order to deliver marketing and advertising services to you. Example: A travel company has its own lists of customers who have purchased travel arrangements with
them, with names, emails, and addresses. The travel company wants to be able to reach out to these
customers with online advertising. The Oracle Advertising services can help the travel company by
converting the company’s own customer lists from identified names, emails, and addresses, to
de-identified groups of cookie and device IDs provided by Oracle Advertising, in a process known in the
advertising industry as “onboarding”. vii. For individuals located in the United States only: to allow our customers to deliver catalogues to your physical address that may be of interest to you based on your previous offline purchase behavior. b) For personal information collected from individuals located outside the EU/EEA/UK and Switzerland only: to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and services We may process personal information for Oracle’s own research and development purposes. For example: to enhance data quality, develop new features and functionality, and for statistical
analyses related to the performance and operation of Oracle Advertising services. c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems We can collect usage and systems operations data from Oracle Advertising services for security and
operations management to help keep Oracle, customer, and partner networks and systems, as well as our
products and services, secure. We may also collect usage and systems operations data to investigate and
prevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, including ad fraud and to detect
bots. d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business In some cases, we may process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For
example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process
personal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and
investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving, and insurance purposes. 6. CATEGORIES OF SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION Oracle may process both offline and online information about you, including information from publicly
available sources or third-party data providers. Offline information (for individuals located in the United States only) about you is obtained by Oracle from its offline partners such as
brick-and-mortar retail stores, grocery stores and their associated loyalty card programs, payment card
brands, catalog orders and consumer survey programs, and third parties who may not have a relationship
with you and collect offline information from their offline partners. Online information about you originates from your activities on sites operated by our
online partners, such as advertising agencies and website operators (for example, online retail stores
or travel sites). Oracle also obtains online information from third parties who may not have a direct
relationship with you and who collect online information using cookies or similar technologies, such as
pixels tags and device identifiers, as you browse the Internet and interact with websites. For more
information on cookies and similar technologies used in connection with Oracle Advertising services,
please refer to Section 12 below. Our online Oracle Advertising branded data partners are listed in our catalogue . Oracle Advertising will not accept third-party data from our partners from individuals in the EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland, Brazil, China, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, and countries subject to US Embargo restrictions. 7. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT YOU COLLECTED IN THE EU/EEA/UK OR SWITZERLAND, WHAT IS OUR LEGAL BASIS? For users located in the EU/EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, Oracle Advertising collects third-party data about users located in the EU/EEA, Switzerland, or the UK only for legal compliance purposes, including for data minimization and to avoid using data from these regions. Specifically, upon initial collection, Oracle Advertising segregates, obfuscates, and purges the data from users in these regions so as to prevent using the data for Oracle’s commercial purposes described above in Section 5 of this Policy. Customers are responsible for their own first-party data collection and processing practices. Please see “First-party information collected about you by Oracle customers” under Section 2 for more information. 8. FOR WHAT PERIOD DO WE RETAIN INFORMATION ABOUT YOU? Oracle maintains information about you for the following retention periods, unless retained solely for legal
and compliance purposes: a) Online information about you is retained for up to 13 months . Certain online information may be retained up to 18 months . For example, Oracle
customers’ seasonal or cyclical interest-based advertising campaigns or internal analytics and
model development may be retained for up to 18 months. b) Online information about you for linkage purposes (cross
device/cross-context technology) is retained for up to 12 months . c) Offline information about you may be retained for as long as relevant for the
purposes for which it was collected (see Section 5 above). Personal information necessary to preserve opt-out preferences is retained for 20 years, unless you
delete it or otherwise prevent its collection as further described in Section
13 below. 9. WHEN AND HOW CAN WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? Sharing within Oracle As a global organization, information about you can be shared globally throughout Oracle’s worldwide
organization for a business purpose(s). See a list of Oracle
entities. Please select a region and country to view the registered address and contact details of the
Oracle entity or entities located in each country. Oracle employees are authorized to access personal information only to the extent necessary to serve the
applicable purpose(s) and to perform their job functions. Disclosing personal information to third parties We may share personal information with or sell personal information to the following third parties for a
commercial purpose: Oracle Advertising customers and partners, including digital marketers, ad agencies, web publishers,
connected TV providers, demand side platforms, data management platforms, supply-side platforms, and
social media networks; and third-party service providers as necessary to perform Oracle Advertising services on behalf of Oracle. We may disclose personal information with the following third parties for a business purpose: relevant third parties in the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment,
transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in
connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings; and public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of
residence (to the extent legally required to respond to their mandatory requests in connection with
national security and/or law enforcement purposes). When third parties are given access to personal information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical,
and organizational measures designed to ensure that personal information is processed only to the extent
that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable
law. 10. HOW IS PERSONAL INFORMATION HANDLED GLOBALLY? Oracle is a global corporation with operations in over 80 countries, and personal information is processed
globally as necessary in accordance with this policy. If personal information is transferred to an Oracle
recipient in a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal information,
Oracle will take adequate measures designed to protect the personal information, such as ensuring that such
transfers are subject to the terms of the EU Model Clauses or other adequate transfer mechanism as required
under relevant data protection laws. 11. HOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU SECURED? Oracle has implemented appropriate technical, physical, and organizational measures designed to protect
personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, damage, alteration,
unauthorized disclosure or access, as well as other forms of unlawful processing. 12. WHAT COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DO WE USE? Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixel tags and device identifiers) are used by Oracle and our
advertising technology partners to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different
services and devices for the purposes specified in Section 5 above. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a
browser on a connected device. We or our Oracle Advertising partners may use cookies to, among other things,
track user trends and collect information about how you use our customers’ sites or interact with
advertising. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be able
to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a
third-party cookie is being sent. Check your browser’s “help” files to learn more about
handling cookies. Pixel Tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1 pixels that are
placed on webpages that use this technology for marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these
webpages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be used with cookies or alone.
When used with cookies, pixel tags can track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant
online advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out of cookies, pixel tags simply detect
a unique website visit and how you interacted with the advertising, but do not track an individual to
provide relevant online advertising. You can opt out of cookies using the opt-out tools in the next section. 13. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? Pursuant to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),
and other applicable laws and regulations, individuals in certain jurisdictions may have data subject rights
enabling them to request to opt-out of third-party sharing or selling, delete or correct, or request to
access and receive a copy of their personal information in Oracle’s possession or for which Oracle is
otherwise responsible. Opt-out and object to our use of information about you Oracle offers multiple ways for you to opt out of third party sharing or selling and object to our use of
information about you: Oracle Advertising Opt-out. Access the Oracle Advertising opt-out
tool . Please note that if you use this opt-out tool, Oracle will opt you out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Advertising services involving both first-party use of your information as well as any third-party sharing or selling of your information. Customers remain responsible for their own first-party data collection and processing practices. See Section 2 above for
more information on the distinction between first-party and third-party information. The Oracle Advertising opt-out will prevent Oracle from delivering third-party audiences to connected
devices such as smart televisions or streaming devices; however, you can also visit your device’s
settings menu or privacy policy for information on how to opt-out directly with your connected devices. AdTech Industry Opt-Out. You may also opt-out of third-party sharing or selling by Oracle Advertising services by using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups. These industry groups provide detailed information on how to opt-out of tailored advertising on a browser or via device settings: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA): http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI): http://optout.networkadvertising.org European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (EDAA): http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and http://www.edaa.eu/ Device Opt-Out. While the opt-out methods described above often also work for mobile web browsing, mobile ‘app’ or other internet connected TV device environments may not accept cookies. You may want to consider installing the AppChoices App provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) to exercise opt-out control for specific companies, including Oracle, when in a mobile app environment. See more information on how to download and configure the AppChoices App relevant for your mobile platform. You can also visit the NAI’s website for more information and instructions on opting out on mobile devices and internet connected TV devices. Audience Matched Advertising Opt-Out. Oracle Advertising provides “Audience Matched Advertising” where Oracle Advertising uses hashed emails to create tailored digital advertising to provide Oracle Advertising online services. The NAI provides an email-based opt-out to opt-out of this activity. Please visit the NAI’s website for more information and instructions on opting out of Audience Matched Advertising. Do Not Track. Oracle honors “Do Not Track” browser settings, meaning we
will not track your browser for marketing purposes while you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your
browser settings. Please note that if you opt-out using any of the first three opt-out tools, you may still temporarily see
interest-based advertising from Oracle Advertising customers due to advertising campaigns from those
customers already underway. However, you will be opted-out of all future advertising campaigns from
customers that use Oracle Advertising services. Also note that the first three opt-out tools are currently cookie-based and prevent Oracle from using,
sharing, or selling your personal information for interest-based advertising on the browser on which they
are installed. As a result, these opt out tools will only function if your browser is set to accept
third-party cookies and may not function where cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed
(e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your browser settings,
switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt out again. Oracle does
not use persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile or deleted cookie. If you want to opt-out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Advertising services, and do not
want to receive third-party cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other
device you are using to connect to the internet. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you
opt-out of all advertising cookies, including Oracle cookies. Delete or correct information about you Unless retained solely for legal and compliance purposes, Oracle will delete or correct your online or
offline personal information, upon request, as set forth below: You can erase or delete all online information about you by opting out of Oracle Advertising
services using the Oracle Advertising
opt-out tool above. If you would like to submit a request to have offline information about you, if any, erased
or deleted, you can use this form . Given the nature and purpose of the processing activities, in the event your personal information contains
any inaccuracies, Oracle will delete your personal information per the process set above for deletion. Access information about you In order to exercise your right to access your online information processed by Oracle
Advertising, you can use the Oracle
Advertising Registry (‘Registry’) to view the online segments Oracle has associated with your
device. By accessing this Registry, you can view the types of third-party interest segments that are shared
with or sold to Oracle Advertising customers. Please note that the interest segments you see within the
Registry is information from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer, or device that you
are using to visit the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry from a different
browser, computer, or device. For a complete picture of the segments associated with all of your browsers
and devices, we therefore recommend using these different browsers and devices when accessing the Registry. To request access to your offline information, please visit the Oracle Advertising access
site, available at https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/request-your-data .
While the majority of offline access requests can be handled quickly, complex requests may take more
research and time. In such cases, you will be contacted regarding the nature of the request and appropriate
next steps within 45 days from the date of receipt of your request. Upon visiting the Oracle Advertising
access site, you will be asked to verify your identity to submit your request. If you cannot verify your
request via the online portal, you can submit a written request via postal mail to the Oracle Global Data
Protection Officer at the address below with a copy of a government-issued ID or other proof of identity for
verification purposes. We cannot provide access to offline data unless Oracle can verify the identity of the
individual making the request. Oracle Advertising only processes offline personal information on residents
within the United States. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law unless such data is only retained for legal
and compliance purposes. Oracle will not discriminate against consumers who have exercised the deletion,
opt-out, or access rights provided to them in this Privacy Policy. We cannot provide first-party information that is collected and maintained by our customers. If you have
questions in regards to first-party information, Oracle recommends that you contact directly the company
that collected it from you. Deceased Do Not Contact Registration with the DMA. We recognize that receiving mail for a
deceased loved one can be difficult for family members, friends, or caretakers. You can opt-out your loved
one using the Oracle Advertising opt-out tool; however, Oracle’s opt-out tool is limited to only Oracle’s
use and sharing of your loved one’s personal information. We recommend using the DMA Deceased Do Not Contact
Registration to remove the names of your deceased loved ones from commercial marketing lists for all
companies that ingest this list, available here: https://www.ims-dm.com/cgi/ddnc.php . 14. DOES ORACLE ADVERTISING COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION? Oracle does not create any online interest segments that reflect personal information that is sensitive, as
defined by law and self-regulatory frameworks, or personal information that Oracle has deemed “sensitive.”
We also have operational procedures in our platform designed to prevent our partners and customers from
using personal information provided to them by Oracle to create interest segments that we consider
sensitive. While the types of personal information considered sensitive may vary among consumers and
applicable law, we treat the following types of personal information as sensitive: precise mental or physical health, biometric, or genetic information, such as a certain sensitive
medical condition like cancer or diabetes; pregnancy, such as pregnancy choices, pregnancy termination, reproductive rights, and traveling to
exercise reproductive rights; certain aspects linked to personal life, such as racial or ethnic, religious, political, citizenship,
immigration status, or sexual orientation; social security or other state identification number, financial account numbers or login information for
such accounts; interest in “adult” activities, such as drug use, an interest in weapons, or pornographic material; and information considered sensitive based on applicable law. We do not allow Oracle Advertising customers or partners to use data provided to them by Oracle: (i) to make
decisions related to an individual’s eligibility for employment, credit, healthcare, insurance, tenancy, or
education purposes; (ii) to make decisions solely by automatic means where the decision has a significant
effect on the individual; or (iii) in any way that may or does discriminate against any person or promote
bigotry, racism, or harm. For these purposes, Oracle considers harm to be inclusive of the use of data
provided by Oracle to target vulnerable individuals or groups with fraudulent or deceptive marketing
campaigns or to be used in any manner that causes vulnerable individuals harm. As noted above, Oracle Advertising does not create interest segments that reflect sensitive medical
conditions. For a list of Oracle Advertising's non-sensitive health and wellness segments, please see this link (PDF) . 15. DOES ORACLE ADVERTISING COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN? We do not intentionally collect or share personal information of children under 16 years of age or allow the
creation of segments targeting children under 16 years of age. Further, we prohibit our Oracle Advertising
partners from providing Oracle with personal information from sites directed to children under the age of 16
