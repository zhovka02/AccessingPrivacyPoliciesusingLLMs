Technologies We Use to Automatically Collect Personal Information Along with companies we partner with, we employ pixel tags, cookies, java scripts, SDKs, local
  shared objects such as Flash (sometimes called “flash cookies”), and similar technology (“tracking
  technologies”) on our digital properties, and third-party digital properties we integrate with. These
  technologies may create unique advertising identifiers (e.g. cookie identifiers or mobile advertising
  identifiers) that reside on your browser or mobile device, and in some cases server-side. Tracking
  technologies may transmit data about your use of our digital properties, including which pages you
  interacted with, your vehicle search history, the advertisements shown to you or that you may have
  clicked on, other page view/click data, the date and time of your visit, all associated with your
  browser or mobile device's advertising identifier. These identifiers typically persist over time.

  of your personal information for digital advertising purposes, see VIII. Your Privacy
  Rights and Choices below. Consistent with IV. How We Use Your Personal Information above, the purposes

        we use a cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for an account. Authentication, Security, and Compliance Prevent fraud, protect user data from unauthorized parties, and for compliance
        with legal requirements. For example, we use cookies to determine if a suspicious
        IP address (based on geography) is logged in through your account. Preferences Track how our digital properties are used and remember preferences. For example,
        we monitor and store your browsing activity to customize your experience and better
        understand your vehicle shopping interests. Notifications Allow notices of information or options that we think could improve the use of the
        site or app. For example, send out notifications of price drop in a vehicle that you
        previously showed interest in. Advertising Make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to our advertisers. For
        example, we may use cookies to serve you targeted ads, such as ads that are displayed
        to you based on your visits to other websites, or to tell us if you have recently
        clicked on an ad. See VIII. Your Privacy Rights and Choices below. Analytics Intended to help us understand how visitors use our digital properties. For example,
        we use a cookie that tells us how our search suggestions correlate to your browsing
