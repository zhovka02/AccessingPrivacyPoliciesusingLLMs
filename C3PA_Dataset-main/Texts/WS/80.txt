            "our," or "us") value your privacy. In this Privacy Policy
            ("Policy"), we describe the information we collect, how we use it, and when
            and to whom we disclose it. This Policy applies to all of our websites, mobile
            applications, and other online services (collectively, the "Platform") made
            available by or through Thumbtack and on which we post this Policy, including through
            our URL www.thumbtack.com and www.setter.com ,
            and to information we collect offline or through other means. Undefined capitalized
            terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our Terms of Use . By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to
            this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE
            PLATFORM. KEY TERMS "Content" means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video,
            information or other materials, including but not limited to profile information, Pro
            Services requests, quotes, message threads, reviews, scheduling and calendar
            information, and other information or materials available on or through the Platform. "Consumer" means a User who is registered to search for Service Professionals
            on the Platform, seeks Pro Services from Service Professionals on the Platform, makes a
            booking with a Service Professional to purchase a Pro Service (or receive a quote in
            contemplation thereof), is registered for or undergoes a home specialist consultation or
            similar service with respect to their home, utilizes a Thumbtack plan to track
            maintenance on a home, is a Thumbtack Plus member, or otherwise uses the Platform to
            receive, pay for, review, or facilitate the receipt of Pro Services. Because a Consumer
            may be, or may become, a customer of a Service Professional, a Consumer is often
            referred to as a “customer” or a “Customer” on the Platform and
            in marketing materials related to the Platform. "Platform" has the meaning set forth in the opening paragraph above. "Pro Services" means the services listed, quoted, scheduled, fulfilled or
            provided by Service Professionals, or sought, scheduled, paid for or received by
            Consumers, through the Platform. "Service Professional" means a User who uses, or is registered to use, the
            Platform to offer, provide, receive payment for, or facilitate the provision of Pro
            Services. Service Professionals are often referred to as “pros” on the
            Platform. "Thumbtack Content" means all Content Thumbtack makes available on or through
            the Platform, including any Content licensed from a third-party, but excluding User
            Content. "User" means a person or entity who uses the Platform, including, for example,
            a person who completes Thumbtack's account registration process, agrees to the Terms
            of Use, utilizes any services offered by or through the Platform, or submits or receives
            a request through Thumbtack, including but not limited to Service Professionals and
            Consumers. "User Content" means all Content submitted, posted, uploaded, published, or
            transmitted on or through the Platform by any User of the Platform, including but not
            limited to photographs, profile information, descriptions, postings, reviews, requests,
            messages, and payments made through the Platform, but excluding Thumbtack Content and Feedback . INFORMATION WE COLLECT How we collect and store information depends on how you access and use the Platform. We
            collect information in multiple ways including when you provide information directly to
            us, when we collect information from affiliates and non-affiliated sources, and when we
            passively collect information from you, such as information collected from your browser
            or device. Information You Provide Directly to Us You may provide us with information about you when you use or access the Platform, such
            as when you register for an account; participate in polls or surveys; enroll for
            electronic newsletters; request a quote or other information; submit or respond to a
            quote; make a purchase; fill out any forms; enter a sweepstakes or contest, or register
            for a promotion; transmit User Content; download or use one of our mobile applications;
            you consent to our collection of information, such as when you grant us permission to
            collect your device’s contact list; or otherwise communicate with us or other
            Users through the Platform. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; this Policy
            applies to all your uses of the Platform. The personal information you provide directly to us may include, but is not limited to:
            (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or business telephone number; (e)
            home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, and
            other information relevant to User surveys and/or offers); (g) date of birth and/or age
            verification; (h) insurance information (if you are a Service Professional); (i)
            photographs and/or video files or audio files (e.g., customer service call recordings);
            (j) information about your project, home, request or need; (k) in certain circumstances,
            payment information; (l) if you are a Service Professional, in certain circumstances,
            identity verification information (such as Social Security number or driver’s
            license information); and/or (m) any other information you include in communications
            with other Users through the Platform or communications with us. It may also include
            your information specific to the services you are requesting or offering through the
            Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and credentials.
            You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the
            Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of the requested
            information. We utilize a third-party payment provider to process payment information (e.g., credit
            card information or bank account information). Information from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and Other Non-Affiliated
                Sources We may collect information about you through Thumbtack affiliates or through
            non-affiliated sources, including public information sources. For example: You may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such as
                Facebook. If you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us
                to have access to certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include
                your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location,
                date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow
                you, and/or your posts or "likes." Social networking sites, such as
                Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information. For a description
                of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including any information
                you make public, please consult those sites' privacy policies. To the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect
                supplemental information about you from non-affiliated sources, such as information
                about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or
                trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine
                information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we
                obtain from such sources, including public information sources and information
                derived from any other products or services we provide. We may collect information that demonstrates the occurrence of an off-Platform
                communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional in order to ensure
                accurate charging of fees imposed upon Service Professionals and to enforce the
                Terms of Use. Except as explicitly stated herein, we will not collect or store the
                contents of any off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service
                Professional. If you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional using the
                telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we may use a third-party
                vendor to track these text messages. We track these text messages for fraud
                prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms of Use, and
                for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Thumbtack and the
                third-party vendor will receive in real time and store data about your text message,
                including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content
                of the text message. Please note that we have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the
            information it collects about you. Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected Device/Usage Information. We and certain third-party vendors, including ad
            networks and analytics providers, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking
            technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile
            devices) you use to access the Platform. As described further below, we and these
            third-party vendors may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a)
            browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e)
            referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers
            (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track
            and record when and how frequently you access or use the Platform, or how you browse the
            Platform. We do not, however, collect keystroke information. We use this information
            (including the information collected by relevant third-party vendors) for Platform
            analytics (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most
            frequently and what our Users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant
            advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising
            campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy. Location Information. When you use the Platform, we may collect general
            location information (such as your location as derived from your IP address). If you
            install our mobile app, depending on your device settings and any permissions you have
            granted, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that
            information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based
            features (e.g., for identification of Pro Services available near you). To deliver
            customized content and advertising, we may disclose your location information to our
            agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and
            you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you may be
            able to disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device. See your
            device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain
            functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform. Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party vendors may
            use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better
            understand User behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and
            improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the
            Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages
            you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also
            use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that
            may interest you or to advertise ourselves and the Platform to you on other sites. We or
            our third-party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our
            Users to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and
            track whether our emails are forwarded. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
            cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline
            cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full
            advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. As we adopt additional
            technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION We may use your information for any of the following reasons: For the purposes for which you provided it; To enable you to use the services available through the Platform, including
                registering you for our services and verifying your identity and authority to use

                services or information you have requested; As permitted under applicable law, to contact you by telephone or text message

                parties, including to protect property or safety; and to enforce any legal terms

            including your name or your business’s name, publicly on your profile, except to
            the extent we tell you we will not display such information. If the information you
            provide us upon signing up for an account differs from the information you provide us as
            part of the verification data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which
            information will be displayed publicly on your profile. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with
            information that we obtain from affiliated and non-affiliated sources, and information
            derived from any other products or services we provide. We may aggregate and/or
            de-identify information we collect. We may use de-identified or aggregated information
            for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes and
            may also disclose such information to any third parties, including without limitation,
            advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others. We may, either directly or through third-party providers we engage to provide services
            to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other Users exchanged via the
            Platform or as otherwise described in this Policy for fraud prevention, risk assessment,
            regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and User support
            purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we may scan and analyze
            messages to prevent fraud or improper actions. We may also scan, review or analyze
            messages for research and product development purposes, as well as to debug, improve and
            expand product offerings. By using the Platform or engaging in off-Platform
            communications tracked by Thumbtack, you consent that Thumbtack, in its sole discretion,
            may, either directly or through third-parties we engage to provide services to us,
            review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through
            automated means. HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also disclose the information that we
            collect as follows: Affiliates. We may disclose your information to any Thumbtack affiliates. Consent. We may disclose your information based on your consent to do so. Vendors. We may provide your information to select third parties who perform
                services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us
                including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market
                research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, identity verification,
                fraud and safety protection and legal services. Legal Requirements. We may disclose your information when required by law or when we
                believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with
                subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive; (b) establish or
                exercise our legal rights including enforcing and administering agreements with
                Users; or (c) defend Thumbtack against legal claims. While you may challenge the
                disclosure request, please be advised we may still be legally required to turn over
                your information. Protection of Thumbtack and Others. We may disclose your information when we believe
                it appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal
                activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical
                safety of any person, violations of the Terms of Use or any other legal terms
                governing use of the Platform, and/or to protect our rights and property and the
                rights and property of others. Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge
                or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all our assets. In
                such contemplated or actual transactions or where there is any change of control of
                Thumbtack, your information may be among the disclosed and/or transferred assets. App Store Providers. We may provide your identity and mobile device identifier to
                third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to
                download our mobile apps. Academics and Research. We may provide information about Users to third-parties for
                academic and research purposes, in anonymized or aggregated form. You may post Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited to, your
            comments, pictures, Service Professional profile, and other information. However, please
            be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Some information you provide and/or
            that we collect may be publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an account
            requires that you provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the
            Platform will use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name,
            or in some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other Users.
            Depending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or
            information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service requests, reviews,
            participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information. Certain
            other people, including other Users with whom you have interacted via the Platform, may
            see information about you that is attached to your name. For example (but without
            limitation), if you are a Consumer seeking Pro Services, the description you provide of
            your desired services, along with your name, will be shown to some Service Professionals
            registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other Users may be able
            to personally identify you based on Content you provide. Similarly, certain information
            we collect, including but not limited to when you last accessed the Platform, may be
            disclosed to other Users with whom you are interacting or otherwise made public. If you choose to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as through
            User-to-User messaging or through our review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings,
            that information: (a) may be or may become publicly available; (b) may be collected and
            used by third-parties with or without our knowledge; and (c) may be used by third
            parties (including other Users) in a manner that may violate this Policy or applicable
            law. ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING Analytics We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of Google
            Analytics. Providers of these services use cookies and similar technologies (as
            described in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above)
            to help us analyze how Users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
            website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology may be
            disclosed to or collected directly by these providers. We may also use Google Analytics;
            to prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install
            the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on . Tailored Advertising We may use advertising services provided by third parties on the Platform, which provide
            their services using cookies and similar technologies (as described in the Information
            That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above). Third parties whose
            products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform may also place such
            technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information
            about your use of the Platform. We, our providers, and third parties collect information
            in this way for advertising and marketing purposes. Certain third-party providers and certain cookies or similar technologies on the
            Platform enable us and third parties to serve you “tailored” advertising
            online that is more relevant to you and your interests. If you are interested in more
            information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies
            from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
            programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
            Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page . We do not
            control any of these opt-out mechanisms and are not responsible for any choices you make
            using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If
            your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you
            subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your
            NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on
            NAI's and DAA's websites. Please note that if you opt out of tailored advertising, you may still receive online
            advertisements about us, the Platform, or third parties on the Platform – however,
            such advertising is not tailored. When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application
            advertising. Each operating system (e.g., iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android
            devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to
            prevent use of your mobile advertising identifier to deliver tailored in-application
            advertising. For more information, you may review the support materials and/or the
            privacy settings for the operating systems and devices you use, or contact the
            applicable provider/operator. PRIVACY OF MINORS Our services are not provided to minors (i.e., persons under the age of 18). We elect to
            provide services only to persons 18 years of age or older, including any use of the
            Platform. If we discover, or if you inform us, that an individual under 18 has provided
            us with personal information, we will close the account and delete that
            individual’s personal information as required by law, including the Children's
            Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain
            information internally for purposes described in this Policy. SECURITY We employ physical, procedural, and technological security measures to help protect your
            information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Thumbtack may use encryption,
            passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your information against
            unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% failsafe.
            Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that
            any information provided or transmitted online is completely secure. You should take
            steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by,
            among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust
            password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password
            private, and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack is not
            responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or
            compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password
            activity. LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS The Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources over which Thumbtack
            does not have any control; please review such other websites’ privacy policies as
            to their use of personal information. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by
            Thumbtack of those third-party websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing
            these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not
            responsible in any way for such third-party websites, including without limitation for
            their content or how they treat information you provide to them. YOUR CHOICES You may review, correct, and delete certain information about you through your account,
            such as by logging in to the Platform and navigating to your preferences page in

            it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove
            your profile information from view as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain
            information from closed accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect
            any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations
            of any User, enforce our Terms of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted
            by law that we deem necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however,
            that once you transmit User Content through the Platform, it may be acquired by others
            who may not be required to delete or modify such User Content. Once we have deactivated
            or removed your account, you agree that Thumbtack will not be responsible for retaining
            information related to your account. We may send periodic emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by following

            have requested or received from us, transactions, or changes to our Terms of Use, this
            Policy, or other relevant terms. We may monitor and record our telephone conversations with you for training and quality
            assurance purposes. You will be provided with a notice at the beginning of any call that

            the Policy above, and except as provided herein, applies solely to California residents
            (as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended, the
            “CCPA”)). It applies to “personal information” (as defined by
            the CCPA) that we collect on or through the Platform and through other means (such as
            information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone). It does not apply to
            business information that does not constitute personal information we collect from
            Service Professionals in their capacity as Service Professionals. This Supplemental
            Privacy Notice for California Residents also does not apply to current or former
            employees of Thumbtack, Inc., independent contractors, or job applicants to jobs at
            Thumbtack, Inc. How We Collect, Use, and Disclose Personal Information The CCPA requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal
            information and sensitive personal information that we have collected about California
            consumers, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, the
            business or commercial purposes (as each of those terms is defined by the CCPA) for
            which we collect personal information, and the categories of parties to whom we disclose
            personal information. Throughout this Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information and
            sensitive personal information we collect, the sources of that information, and how we
            disclose it. Under the CCPA, we also have to provide you with the "categories"
            of personal information and sensitive personal information we collect and disclose for
            “business or commercial purposes” (as those terms are defined by the CCPA). As described further in the Policy above, the following table provides information about
            our practices in the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Policy in
            relation to the categories of personal information that we generally collect from
            California and Colorado residents, the sources of the information, the purposes for
            which we use the information, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose

            personal information,” as that term is defined in the CCPA. The sensitive personal
            information we may have collected in the preceding twelve months are: (1) account log-in
            and password or other credentials allowing access to your account; (2) certain
            user-to-user communications made through our Platform, including Member-to-Member text
            messages; (3) precise geolocation; (4) Social Security number; and (5) driver’s
            license number. The CCPA provides you with the right to limit certain uses and
            disclosures of your sensitive personal information. You may limit the use of precise
            geolocation for advertising purposes by opting out of the “sale” or
            “sharing” of such information, as discussed below. We do not use or disclose
            any other sensitive personal information for purposes that are subject to the right to
            limit. We may combine the information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of
            information (“de-identify”) to limit or prevent identification of any
            particular User or device. We may use or disclose this aggregated or de-identified
            information in our discretion. Your CCPA Rights If you are a California resident (as defined by the CCPA), you may have the right to
            request that we: Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed
                about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial
                purpose for collecting, “sharing” or “selling” your personal
                information as those terms are defined by the CCPA; the categories of third parties
                to whom we disclose or “sell” or with whom we “share”
                personal information; and the categories of personal information we
                “sell” or “share.” Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we have about you. Delete certain personal information we have about you. Correct inaccurate personal information we have about you. You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we
            offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as
            provided for in California law) for exercising certain of your rights referenced herein.
            Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. In addition,
            we need certain types of information so that we can provide our services to you. If you
            ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our services. To exercise any of these rights, you may submit a request at dataprivacy@thumbtack.com or visit https://help.thumbtack.com/data-privacy . You will be required to verify your identity before we are able to fulfill your
            request, for instance by logging into the Thumbtack platform. You can also designate an
            authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with
            written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on
            your behalf. You may still need to verify your identity directly with us. You also have the right to opt out of “sales” and “sharing” of
            your personal information as described below. “Sales” of personal information. Thumbtack may disclose certain
            identifiers (like IP address and email address), internet or other electronic network
            activity information (like information regarding an individual’s browsing
            interactions on the Platform), and commercial information (like the fact that a browser
            visited a page with home improvement tips) to certain analytics, advertising, and
            marketing providers in ways that may be considered “sales” under the CCPA.
            Thumbtack also discloses Consumers’ identifiers (like name) and general location
            information (like zip code) to select Service Professionals to better enable those
            Consumers to find a Service Professional who can provide a service the Consumer has
            expressed interest in. Under the CCPA, these may be considered “sales” of
            your personal information. “Sharing” personal information. Under the CCPA,
            “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on
            that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity
            across websites. We “share” information for these purposes to provide more
            relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Platform. As part of this
            advertising, we may “share” certain identifiers (like IP address and email
            address), internet or other electronic network activity information (like information
            regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on the Platform), and commercial
            information (like the fact that a browser visited a page with home improvement tips)
            with advertising platforms and advertising networks. To opt out of our “sale” and “sharing” of your personal
            information as described above, you may follow the instructions on our
            “sale” and “sharing” opt-out page here . Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through
            the Global Privacy Control. Any opt-out preferences you have exercised through these
            methods will only apply to the specific device/browser on which you made them. For more
            information on how to use the Global Privacy Control, see https://globalprivacycontrol.org . Retention of Your Personal Information We will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide
            the Platform and our services or until you delete or modify your information. We also
            reserve the right to retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
            legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. California Shine the Light Disclosure If you are a California resident, you may ask for a list of third parties that have
            received your information for direct marketing purposes during the previous calendar
            year. If we have disclosed your information, this list will contain the types of
            information disclosed, and we will provide this list at no cost. To make such a request,
            contact us at dataprivacy@thumbtack.com . California Do-Not-Track Disclosure Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information
            collected on our Platform for third-party purposes. That is why we have provided links
            (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a Google
            opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
            browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still
            working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations, and solutions. Please note that
            Do-Not-Track is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser
            choice referenced above. SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY NOTICE FOR RESIDENTS OF OTHER U.S. STATES Residents of certain other states, such as Colorado, Virginia, and Connecticut, may have
            certain rights regarding their “personal data,” as defined in these
            states’ laws (“personal information”), that we process. Residents of Colorado may click here to view more
            information regarding each category of personal information we process (including
            sensitive data (called “sensitive personal information” above)), the sources
            of such information, the purposes for which we process each category of personal
            information, and the categories of entities to whom the personal information is
            disclosed. Residents of Colorado may click here to view
            more information about the categories of personal information that are
            “sold” or used for “targeted advertising” (as defined in
            Colorado law). Please note that we do not engage in profiling that produces legal or
            similarly significant effects. Your state law may permit you to request that we: Confirm whether or not we are processing your personal information and provide you
                with access to such personal information; Correct inaccuracies in your personal information, taking into account the nature of
                the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal
                information; Delete your personal information; Provide you a copy of personal information that you previously provided to us in a
                portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows
                you to transmit the data to another business, where our processing is carried out by
                automated means; and Opt you out of processing of personal information for purposes of profiling in
                furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects
                concerning you (please note that we do not engage in this kind of processing). Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example,
            we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Platform to you. If you
            ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Platform. To exercise any of these rights, you may submit a request at dataprivacy@thumbtack.com or visit https://help.thumbtack.com/data-privacy You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. To do so,
            you will need to provide the information identified in the webform or as otherwise
            directed by us. You also have the right to opt out of the processing of the “sale” of your
            personal information and the processing of your personal information for purposes of
            “targeted advertising,” as defined in applicable law. Click here for more information about the categories of
            personal information that are “sold” or used for “targeted
            advertising” (also called “sharing” in some states). Applicable law may also permit you to appeal any denials of your rights requests; to do
            so, contact us at dataprivacy@thumbtack.com and describe in
            detail why you believe the denial was in error. Your description must include your full
            name and the email address used for your account with us, along with a copy of the
            denial notice you received from us. NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “personally
            identifiable information” for monetary consideration. “Personally
            identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address,
            phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a person to be
