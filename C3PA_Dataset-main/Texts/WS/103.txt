This Chick-fil-A Privacy Policy (" Privacy Policy ") describes how Chick-fil-A, Inc., its affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities such as CFA Properties, Inc., CFA Servco, Inc., Chick-fil-A Canada ULC, and Chick-fil-A (PR) LLC, (collectively, “ Chick-fil-A ”, “ CFA Group ”, “ we ”, “ us ”, or “ our ”) process and use the personal information that we collect through our websites and mobile apps (" Online Services "), our restaurant technologies such as Wi-Fi services at your favorite Chick-fil-A Restaurant, our interactions with you over the phone or offline related to our products and services (collectively, together with Online Services, the " Services "), and other sources. We would love for you to know how we gather information about you and use that information to make your Chick-fil-A experience more remarkable across both online and offline worlds.  So, this Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect about you and how we process personal information.  We have tried to make this Privacy Policy clear and easy to navigate, but if you don’t understand something, please feel free to reach out.  You can contact us as described in the “Contact Us” Section. Please note this Privacy Policy describes how Chick-fil-A generally handles personal information across various Services, so we will let you know when a specific Service is subject to a separate privacy policy that supplements or supersedes this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any affiliate or related entity of Chick-fil-A, Inc. that maintains and publishes its own privacy policy.  Also, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee because Chick-fil-A restaurants are owned and operated by Franchised Operators and Licensees who are independent third parties.  Please see the “Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services” Section for more information. 1. We Make Updates to This Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and the updated Privacy Policy applies to you after the effective date stated in the revised Privacy Policy.  Please come back to this page occasionally to check to see if it has been updated.  You can also contact us as described in the “Contact Us” Section to receive a copy of the current Privacy Policy.  If our information practices change, we will post an updated policy on our website.  If we change the policy in a material way, we will provide appropriate notice to you such as posting a prominent notice on our website or emailing you if you provided your email to us. 2.

This may also include recordings of telephone conversations you may have with our CARES customer support personnel. Content you share on our Online Services or social media pages (e.g., stories, comments, blogs, postings, etc.) may include personal information. You are responsible for all actions resulting from any information you post on our Online Services or social media pages. Please remember that any information you post on social media pages may become publicly available, is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and Chick-fil-A is not responsible for the results of such postings. 3. Information We Collect Automatically or from Others We may obtain some information automatically, for example, when you: (a)	Access or use the Online Services Traffic Data. Our Online Services automatically track and collect your IP address, domain server, type of computer or device, and type of web browser. This helps us customize your online experience and assists with our marketing. We use this information to make our online experience better and more relevant for you.  For example, we can show you menu items for the correct time of day in your location. We also use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on your computer and allow websites to remember information about you (“ Cookies ”).  You may adjust your browser and/or Chick-fil-A's Cookie Preference Center settings to accept or reject certain Cookies. However, if you decide not to accept certain Cookies from our Online Services, you may not be able to take advantage of all available features.  Please see our Cookie and Interest-based Advertising Policy to learn about the types of Cookies we use, how we use them, and your choices for Cookies. Additionally, we process opt-out preference signals from Global Privacy Control (" GPC" ). GPC is a browser-level technical specification that you can use to inform websites that you opt-out of sales or sharing of data for cross-context behavioral advertising or targeted advertising. If you use GPC, our website will treat the browser you use to access our website as opted-out from sales or sharing to the extent we engage in such processing.  If you access our website from another browser, you will need to install GPC on that browser.  You may learn how to set up GPC by visiting https://globalprivacycontrol.org/ . Web Beacons. Certain pages on the Online Services and social media pages may contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, and clear GIFs), which are small bits of code embedded in pages or images on the Online Services and social media pages (“Web Beacons”). The Web Beacons may be used with Cookies to understand how you interact with us, so we can manage and improve those interactions.  We may also include Web Beacons in e-mails we send to you to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded. This helps us improve future messages and makes them more meaningful to you. Other Technologies. We also utilize other tracking technologies.  For example, if permitted by applicable law, we may collect “referrers”.  A “referrer” is information your web browser passes along to web servers that refers to the URL from which you accessed the Online Services. Like most websites, we may also collect environmental variables, which include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed the Online Services or social media pages, the type of web browsers and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the website you left to visit the Online Services or social media pages, the names of the web pages you visit, the Internet address of the website you visit next, and your browser settings (e.g., language preference). We use these technologies to collect and retain usage data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for marketing and security purposes and to improve your experience with our Online Services. Information collected automatically may be combined with other personal information we have about you so that we can improve and customize the Online Services and our communications and promotions. When we know how you interact with our Online Services, we can serve you better. In a nutshell, the following are examples of information we collect with these automated technologies: your IP address, browser type, and operating system; the mobile device you use and its temporary or persistent unique device identifiers; pages you view within the Online Services; websites you visited before coming to the Online Services; video viewing history for videos you watch on the Online Services; emails from us that you open and/or forward; and/or offers or links from us to which you connect. (b)	Use location-enabled devices like a mobile phone to access the location-based services If you utilize any of the location-based services such as “Find a Restaurant” on our Online Services or from location-enabled devices like your mobile phone or tablet, with your consent where required, we may collect, use, store, and disclose location data, including the real-time geographic location of your device (e.g., when you permit our access to GPS location on your device). We use the location data to provide Services such as mobile order fulfillment, and to improve location-based services, to enhance your experience and our operations, and for marketing and promotions. We may disclose your location data to third-party service providers who help us provide the Services such as identifying nearby restaurants, surfacing available market offers, and estimating mobile order pickup or delivery timing. You may limit access to your location data by adjusting the permissions in your device. If you grant us permission, we may collect location information when the app is running in the foreground or background. (c)	Order or purchase our products or services We also collect information, through our business partners, relating to your purchases from us and our Franchised Operators and Licensees to process your transactions and to perform research and marketing analytics, such as the authorization code of the transaction, payment method, the date and time of the transaction, items purchased, the purchase price, and other order or purchase related information. (d)	Use social media platforms or other connected third-party services The Online Services and our communications may contain links to third-party websites, including social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn (collectively, “ Linked Sites ”). We are not responsible for the privacy practices, policies, or content of any Linked Sites, even if you followed a link to them from the Online Services or our communications. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Linked Sites. We encourage you to read and understand the privacy policies of any Linked Sites that you visit. We may obtain information about you from Linked Sites.  For example, when you link your account or engage with the Online Services through Linked Sites such as third-party social media sites, you may be allowing us to have ongoing access to certain information stored on those Linked Sites as described to you by those Linked Sites (e.g., your public profile, profile photo, friends list).  We may receive certain information about you which is stored on Linked Sites if other users of those sites give us access to their profiles and you are one of their friends or connections, depending upon your settings on those Linked Sites.  The information we have access to from Linked Sites varies and is controlled by your privacy settings on each Linked Site and by your consent. We also obtain some personal information from others, for example: Your Friends and Family. We may obtain additional information about you when someone, like your friend or family member, provides your information to us as part of their transaction with us (e.g., facilitating an order pick-up) or a referral or promotional program (e.g., refer-a-friend program). If we offer you the ability to share information with a friend or family member through email or other means, we rely on you to ensure that you only share information with individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the communication. We will use the contact information you provide to communicate with your friend or family member on your behalf. Franchised Operators and Licensees. We process information about you from our Franchised Operators and Licensees when we provide certain services for them.
