For example, we may receive information about you from a partner when we jointly offer services or from an advertiser about your experiences with them. By gathering additional information about you, we can correct inaccurate information and give you product recommendations and special offers more likely to interest you. How We Use Your Information Our primary purpose in collecting information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your information in a variety of ways, including for the following purposes: Product and Service Fulfillment We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and improve your experience.

In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, we may use personal information without your consent or court process. How We Share Your Information: While we do not directly sell, rent, or loan your personally identifiable information, we may share your information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Walgreens as described below. Please note that certain state laws have adopted a broad definition of a "sale" or "share" and may treat certain of these disclosures as sales or sharing under their definitions. Please see the "Information for California Consumers" , "Information for Colorado Consumers" , "Information for Connecticut Consumers" and "Information for Virginia Consumers" sections for additional information. Internally We may share your information with our parent company or affiliates, including but not limited to, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., Boots Retail USA Inc., Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy Holdings, LLC, and Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy, LLC DBA Alliance Rx Walgreens Pharmacy. When We Work With Third Parties We may share your information with affiliated and unaffiliated companies that perform tasks on our behalf related to our business. Such tasks include analyzing website usage data, customer service, electronic and postal mail service, and social and other media services. We may work with other companies who place cookies, tags, and web beacons on our websites. These companies help operate our websites and provide you with additional products and services. We may also use third-party advertising networks to serve advertisements on our behalf. The cookies received with the banner advertisements served by these networks may be used to collect and build behavioral profiles by these companies to deliver targeted advertisements on our website and unaffiliated websites. We may work with other companies who operate their own websites or mobile applications, to allow them to offer Walgreens customers the ability to connect to Walgreens services. These services give you more options for ways to use Walgreens services from websites or applications that are not owned or operated by Walgreens. We contract with partner companies to allow Walgreens customers to access one of their loyalty program  accounts from those partners' websites and/or mobile applications. This may include the ability to join a loyalty program, add an existing membership, and/or access your account balance. If you participate in a loyalty program component which permits you to connect your loyalty program accounts with websites, application and devices, including non-Walgreens partners and their websites, application and devices. Notwithstanding the uses and disclosures set forth above, Walgreens may use or disclose personally identifiable information gathered under one of its loyalty programs for improving health, health research, or with your consent. Social Media: Our online services may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook "Like" button, "Share to Twitter" button) to enable you to easily interact with certain social media websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and share information with others. When you visit our services, the operators of the available social media plugins can place a cookie on your device enabling such operators to recognize individuals who have previously visited our services. If you are logged in to these social media websites while visiting our services, the social media plugins allow the relevant social media websites to receive information that you have visited our services or other information. The social media plugins also allow the applicable social media websites to share information about your activities on our services with other users of the social media website. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. We may also interact with you on social media platforms. If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request services, or otherwise communicate directly with us on social media, we may contact you to interact with you. For more information about social media advertising and social media plugins from other social media websites, please refer to those websites' privacy and data sharing statements. We may share your information with business partners who may offer services or products to you.  For example, in connection with the myWalgreens credit card, we share some information with our partner so it can prescreen individuals to see if they qualify for offers.  You can learn about your rights relating to prescreened offers including how to opt out by calling 1-888-567-8688 or by going to https://www.optoutprescreen.com/. Certain state laws may also allow consumers the ability to opt out of processing activities that may be considered "profiling" under state law, such as prescreened credit card offers. Please see the "Information for California Consumers" , "Information for Colorado Consumers" , "Information for Connecticut Consumers" and "Information for Virginia Consumers" for additional information. When Sharing is Required by Law or Helps Us Protect Our Interests We will disclose your information as necessary or appropriate under applicable law, to comply with legal process, to respond to such requests from public and government authorities, to enforce our terms and conditions, including investigations of potential violations, to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and to allow us to pursue available remedies to limit the damages that we may sustain. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, we may use or disclose personal information without your consent or court process. When We Work On Business Transactions As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets, or engage in mergers, acquisitions or sale of company assets. Personal information may be disclosed in connection with the evaluation of or entry into such transactions or related business arrangements, or in the course of providing transition of services to another entity as permitted by law. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Additionally, in the event that Walgreens or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will likely be one of the transferred assets as is permissible under law. Non-identifiable or Aggregate information with Third Parties We may share non-identifiable or aggregate information with third parties for lawful purposes. With Your Consent At your direction or request, or when you otherwise consent, we may share your information. Your Choices By interacting with any of the Walgreens family of companies as described herein, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

In-Store Location You can opt out from further allowing Walgreens to access your Bluetooth signal in our stores by adjusting the location permissions in your mobile device or from the Walgreens mobile application. Online Tracking and Interest-Based Advertisements Walgreens engages third-party advertisers to provide interest-based advertising on our website, as well as other third-party websites in order to display advertising that is relevant to you. These third parties may collect information about your use of our services over time and that information may be combined with information collected on different websites and online services. These third-party advertisers may be participants in the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising, which allow users to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies. To learn more about interest-based advertising, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used by certain third-party advertisers for behavioral advertising purposes, go to: www.aboutads.info/choices or https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please Note: When you "opt out" of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from Walgreens. It means that the online ads that you do see will not be tailored for you based on your particular interests. We may still collect information about you for any purpose permitted under the Policy, including for analytics and fraud prevention. Our "Do Not Track" Policy Walgreens respects enhanced user privacy controls. We support the development and implementation of a standard "do not track" browser feature, which signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Please note that at this time Walgreens.com does not interpret or respond to "do not track" signals. However, you may set your Web browser to not accept new cookies or web beacons, be notified when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. Please note that by disabling these features, your experience on Walgreens.com will not be as smooth and you will not be able to take full advantage of our website's features. Please see the Help section of your browser for instructions on managing security preferences. Minors If you are under 18 years old and a registered user, you can request that we remove content or information that you have posted to our website or other online services. Note that fulfilment of the request may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal (e.g., if the content or information has been reposted by another user). To request removal of content or information, please contact us. Accessing and Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information You can review and update information you have given us by emailing us or calling 877-924-4472. Our customer care staff will update your information. If you have a Walgreens.com account, you can log in and update your information. Links to Third-Party Websites Our services may contain links to, or otherwise make available, social media websites and other third-party services, websites and mobile applications that are operated and controlled by third parties. We do not take responsibility for the content or the privacy practices employed by other websites. Unless otherwise stated, any Information you provide to any such third-party website will be collected by that party and not by Walgreens, and will be subject to that party's privacy policy (if any), rather than this Privacy Policy. In such a situation, we will have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, that party's use of the Information you provide to them. How We Protect Your Information Security Measures Walgreens recognizes the importance of maintaining the security of your information. Whether you are shopping on our website, through our mobile services, or in our stores, we use reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Email Security "Phishing" is a common email scam where your email address is used to contact you and ask for personally identifiable or sensitive information. Always be cautious when opening links or attachments from unsolicited third parties. Also know that Walgreens will not send you emails asking for your credit card number, social security number or other personally identifiable information. If you are ever asked for this information, you can be confident it is not from Walgreens. Children's Personal Information We recognize the importance of protecting children's online privacy. Our website and mobile services are intended for a general audience and are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13.

We offer these programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. We invest heavily in our marketing and brands, in part, so we can provide programs to our customers.   Consumer data is more valuable to our business when it is combined with a sufficient amount of other consumer data and after it is enhanced by our efforts described in this Privacy Policy.  The value to our business of any individual consumer's data is dependent on a number of factors, including, for example, whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings, whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings, and whether we are able to enhance the data through our efforts described in this Privacy Policy. We do not calculate the value of consumer data in our accounting statements.  We make this good faith estimate for California residents. To the extent we create overall value from our programs to our business that could be directly or reasonably related to the value of customer data, the method for calculating the value would include: (1) costs related to maintaining the program including but not limited to IT infrastructure, delivery of offers, and skilled marketing teams with the appropriate knowledge to enhance customer data; (2) whether the sales generated by the program exceeds the cost to us of offering the program including value of discounts to customer; and (3) value of the insights we are able to create based upon aggregate data. Deidentified Patient Information. We may also disclose information that does not identify an individual and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual which is derived from CA Personal Information, as well as deidentified protected health information that has been modified to remove individually identifiable information in accordance with HIPAA's expert determination (also known as "statistician's method") or safe harbor deidentification standards.

You may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf. The agent must be a natural person or a business entity that is registered with the California Secretary of State. If you would like to designate an agent to act on your behalf, your agent must provide us your CA Personal Information as required on the request form and provide signed documentation demonstrating that you authorized the agent to submit a request on your behalf. For access and correction requests, the agent must also follow the verification process outlined below. Please note that this subsection does not apply when an agent is authorized to act on your behalf pursuant to a valid power of attorney. Any such requests will be processed in accordance with California law pertaining to powers of attorney. Requests for Household Information. There may be some types of CA Personal Information that can be associated with a household (a group of people living together in a single dwelling). Requests for access, correction, or deletion of household CA Personal Information must be made by each member of the household. We will verify each member of the household using the verification criteria explained below. Verification of Requests. Our verification process depends on the type of request you submit to exercise a California Consumer Right as described above. Access and Correction Requests For Access and Correction requests, you will enter a two-part verification process. You must verify your identity by correctly answering demographic questions powered through LexisNexis® and confirm control over the email address you provide in the request form. If you successfully complete the LexisNexis® demographic questions and email confirmation, you will proceed to part two of the process in which we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonably high degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows: Access request: Your access report will include the specific pieces of CA Personal Information not otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law that we match to you. If requested, your access report will also be provided in a portable, machine-readable format. Correction request: If we determine the contested data to be inaccurate based on the totality of the circumstances, unless otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law, your data will be corrected. If you fail the LexisNexis® demographic questions but successfully complete email confirmation, you proceed to part two of the process in which we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonable degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows: Access request: Your access report will include the categories of CA Personal Information we match to you unless otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law. Correction request: Your correction request cannot be processed if you fail the LexisNexis® demographic questions. If you fail both LexisNexis® and email confirmation, your Access or Correction request will be cancelled, and you will be notified. Deletion and Appeal Requests For Deletion and Appeal requests, you must confirm control over the email address you provide in the request form. If you successfully complete email confirmation, we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonably high degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows: Deletion request: All data matched to you and not otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law will be deleted. Appeal request: Your appeal request will be reviewed, and you will receive a communication with the outcome of the appeal, including any additional rights you may have. If you are matched to a reasonable degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows: Deletion request: Certain limited data we associate to you will be deleted. Appeal request: We will review your appeal request and, after considering the totality of the circumstances, will respond accordingly. If you fail email confirmation, your Deletion or Appeal request will be cancelled, and you will be notified. Opt-Out Requests and Requests to Limit Requests to opt-out of profiling or sale and sharing of your CA Personal Information and requests to limit the use and disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information do not require LexisNexis® verification. Nondiscrimination. Should you wish to request the exercise of your rights as detailed above with regard to your CA Personal Information, we will not discriminate against you. To the extent you provide CA Personal Information in connection with programs such as myWalgreens, additional information about the terms applicable to those programs, including our use of CA Personal Information in exchange for the applicable financial incentives, can be found in the terms and conditions for those programs and in the Notice of Financial Incentive section above.
