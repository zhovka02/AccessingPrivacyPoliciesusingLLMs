Learn more about your rights if you are a California resident and how to exercise them Collection, use, and retention of Personal Information The general section of this Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it in categories that are easy to understand. The CCPA requires us to disclose the personal information we have collected about consumers in the following categories. Some of the categories include very different types of information within the same category and certain personal information may fall into multiple categories. How we use and how long we keep the information within each category will vary , and not all types of information within the same category will be used for all the purposes listed. California law also requires us to provide information regarding the criteria we use to determine the length of time for which we retain personal information. We utilize the following criteria to determine the length of time for which we retain personal information: The business purpose for which the information is used, and the length of time for which the information is required to achieve those purposes; Whether we are required to retain the information in order to comply with legal obligations or contractual commitments, or is otherwise necessary to investigate theft or other illegal activities, to ensure a secure online environment, or to protect health and safety; The privacy impact on the consumer of ongoing retention, including the consumer's likely expectations in light of the sensitivity of information and our Privacy Commitments; and The manner in which information is maintained and flows through our systems, and how best to manage the lifecycle in light of the volume and complexity of the systems in our infrastructure. Individual pieces of personal information such as those listed above may exist in different systems that are used for different business or legal purposes. A different maximum retention period may apply to each use case of the information. Certain individual pieces of information may also be stored in combination with other individual pieces of information, and the maximum retention period may be determined by the purpose for which that information set is used.
