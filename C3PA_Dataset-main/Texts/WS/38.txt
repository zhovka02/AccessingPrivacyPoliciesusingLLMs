  information we collect about you, many of which are subject to exceptions
  under applicable law: The right to access and disclosure. You may have the
  right to request, twice during a twelve-month period, the following
  information about the personal information we have collected about you during
  the past 12 months: the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected
    about you; the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information; the business or commercial purpose for which we collected or sold the
    personal information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal
    information; and the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a
    business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom we sold or
    disclosed that information for a business purpose. The right to deletion. You may have the right to
  request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We
  need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.
  If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our
  Services. How to exercise your access and deletion rights. California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by by
  sending an email to californiaprivacypolicy@harpercollins.com or by contacting us at 1-800-277-3110. For security purposes, we will verify your identity – in part by requesting
  certain information from you -- when you request to exercise your California
  privacy rights. For instance, you may need to provide your name and email
  address. To request that we provide you with the specific pieces of personal
  information we have from you or to delete personal information we have
  collected from you, we may need to ask you for additional information to
  verify your identity. If you have an online account with us, logging into your account will serve to
  verify your identity and request, although we may request additional
  information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not
  have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of
  your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from
  you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on
  the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought. Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will
  respond to your request as appropriate: Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have
    collected about you, we will describe the type and format of the information
    disclosure. Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will
    provide the information you have requested, except where not permitted under
    applicable law or otherwise exempted by the CCPA. For instance, we may not
    disclose government ID or financial account number as such disclosure may
    create an unreasonable risk to your personal information, your account with
    us, or our business systems Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have
    collected from you, we will delete, deidentify, or aggregate any information
    about you that is not necessary for the purposes indicated above. Certain
    information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above,
  we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not
  comply with your request. The right to nondiscrimination. We will not deny,
  charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods
  or services if you choose to exercise these rights. The right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  California law broadly defines sale such that it may include your contact information that may be “sold” to our subsidiaries and affiliated businesses or the Activity Information shared with select third parties as described in the Information We Share section of our Privacy Notice. You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information. If you would like to opt out, you may do so as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Personal Information Authorized Agents You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under
  CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the
  person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that
  your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through
  providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of
  attorney. How To Contact Us If you are a California Consumer, to submit a request, please contact us at californiaprivacypolicy@harpercollins.com or call us at 1-800-277-3110. To protect your privacy and maintain
  security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to
  your personal information or complying with your request. To the extent
  permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with
  your request.
