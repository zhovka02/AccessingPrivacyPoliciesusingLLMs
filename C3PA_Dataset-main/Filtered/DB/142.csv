Other states’ statutes (“Other Applicable States”) provide their residents with similar rights and choices, with certain variations. Those states are Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, whose privacy statutes go into effect at various times during 2023.\n\nThis section of the Privacy Policy applies if you are a natural person who is a resident of California (“California Consumer”) or Other Applicable States, and uses our Services. This Addendum supplements the information in the Privacy Policy. However, this Addendum is intended solely for, and is applicable only as to residents of those states.",Updated Privacy Policy
