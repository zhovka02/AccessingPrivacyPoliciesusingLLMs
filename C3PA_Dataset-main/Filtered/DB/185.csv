Our Sites are not directed to European Union (EU) residents. Data protection regulations in Europe require us to disclose additional information regarding any personal data that may be collected from residents of the EEA, and to limit our use of such information in specific ways. This section provides additional information applicable to European personal data only, which may not apply to users in other geographies.

Effective May 25, 2018, pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Eu residents may have certain statutory rights in relation to his or her personal data.  Subject to any exemptions provided by law, EU residents may have the right to request access to their personal data, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct personal data.  An EU resident can do this as outlined in this policy.  To the extent that we process Eu resident personal data that is subject to the GDPR, we rely on our legitimate interests in operating the Site or providing services to you or our customer (as controller) to process such data.  We may also process information that constitutes EU resident personal data for direct marketing purposes, and EU residents have a right to object to our use of such personal data for this purpose at any time.

As a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or is required by law or other legal obligations.

We use several safeguards if we transfer EU resident personal data originating from the European  Union,  the  European  Economic  Area and their member states,  Switzerland and the  United  Kingdom to other countries not deemed adequate under applicable data protection law, in compliance with GDPR, including using contractual protections that EU regulators have pre-approved to ensure your data is protected.

EU residents may access the personal data we hold about them, request that inaccurate, outdated or no longer necessary information be corrected, erased or restricted, and ask us to provide data in a format that allows an EU resident to transfer it to another person. EU residents may also withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process personal data or object to our processing of the EU resident’s personal data where that processing is based on our legitimate interest.
