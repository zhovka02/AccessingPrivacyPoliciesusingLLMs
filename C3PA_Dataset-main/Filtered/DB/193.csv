ra4,"ADDITIONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR EEA, UK AND SWITZERLAND USERS
If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, you have the following additional rights:

Erasure.
In addition to the opt-out rights described above, you may have the right to request that we erase Personal Data we hold about you in certain situations. You can exercise these rights by contacting our Data Protection Officer at privacy@nativo.com or by filling out our Data Subject Request Form. Since we don’t have a way to identify your data by name in our systems, we may need to request certain information from you (such as the applicable Cookie ID and Mobile Advertising IDs from your systems) to complete this request.

When we receive an eligible request to erase your Personal Data, we will try to comply with it as soon as reasonably practicable and (in any event) within one month.

Access.
You may also have the right, in certain situations, to request that we provide you with the Personal Data associated with your current Cookie ID and/or Mobile Advertising ID. You can exercise this right, if applicable, by contacting our Data Protection Officer at privacy@nativo.com or by filling out our Data Subject Request Form. Since we don’t have a way to identify your data by name in our systems, we may need to request certain information from you (such as the applicable Cookie ID and Mobile Advertising IDs from your systems) to complete this request.

When we receive an eligible request to provide you with the Personal Data associated with your current Cookie ID and/or Mobile Advertising ID, we will try to comply with it as soon as reasonably practicable and (in any event) within one month.  

Correction and amendment.
As the Personal Data we hold about you is ‘pseudonymous’ (for more information on what this means, see here), we do not know who you are. This means we would not be able to correct or amend any Personal Data that may be inaccurate.

However, if you believe we hold information about you that is inaccurate or you would like to correct or amend, we recommend you contact our Data Protection Officer at: privacy@nativo.com or by filling out our Data Subject Request Form.

Right to object.
You may have a right to object to our use of your Personal Data, in certain situations. If you want to exercise this right at any time, the quickest and easiest way to do so is by ‘opting out’ following the steps described here.

Alternatively, you may also have the right to request that we ‘erase’ your Personal Data by following the steps outlined here. However, this will be a more manual, lengthier process.

Complaints.
If you would like to make a complaint regarding this Interest Based Ads Policy or our practices in relation to your Personal Data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@nativo.com

We will reply to your complaint as soon as we can and in any event, within forty-five (45) days.

If you feel that your complaint has not been adequately resolved, please note that the GDPR gives you the right to contact your local data protection supervisory authority, which for the UK, is the Information Commissioner’s Office.
