When you visit our website or use our Pro Insight service, we may collect certain information by automated means such as cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts. This Usage Information may include standard information from a web browser (such as browser type and browser language), an IP address, device identifier numbers, and the actions a website visitor or Customer takes on Pro Insight (such as how a visitor/Customer interacts with the web pages and the links clicked). For detailed information about the use of cookies and similar technologies, please see our below short summary and our Cookie Consent Tool.\nCookies: Our Web pages and Pro Insight use “cookies” and similar technologies. A cookie is a file stored on your device that may be used to identify an individual as a unique user by storing certain personal preferences and user data. We use cookies and other technologies to identify your device, identify authorized users of Pro Insight, and track affiliate referrals.\nWeb Beacons: We may also use web beacons, small graphic images, or other web programming code which may be included in our Web pages and e-mail messages. We may use Web beacons (or similar technologies) to count visitors to Pro Insight, and to monitor how users navigate Pro Insight, among other legitimate business purposes.\nLog files, IP addresses, URLs, embedded scripts, and similar data: We gather certain information automatically to administer the Services and analyze trends in the aggregate.

Also, Ekata automatically receives the URL of the Web site from which a business Customer came (if a business Customer follows a link to the Pro Insight). This information is used to analyze overall trends, and to provide and improve the Services. For example, Ekata collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of security features to confirm identity or detect compromised accounts.
