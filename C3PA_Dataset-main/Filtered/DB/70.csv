ra3,"Information Collected Directly by Us

DPI is the sole owner of the information collected through our websites or directly by our company representatives. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email, contact form, or other direct contact initiated by you. We may gather your name, address, email address, telephone number, IP Address, and/or Mobile Device ID in your voluntary use of our websites or when you contact our representatives.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us, and for appropriate follow-up. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order, or as a means to enhance our communications with you (like via an email provider). This information is used solely to help us better communicate directly with you. We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.

Unless you specifically ask us not to, we may contact you via telephone, email, text message, or online display in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy. If you do not wish us to contact you any further, please see the Opt Out section below on how to unsubscribe from our communications.

B. Information We License from Third-Parties

Our core business is relicensing consumer and business information to help our clients market their products and services more effectively. The products we sell contain information on individuals and households that we license from third-parties. The information we license to our clients is collected by our third-party partners from many sources. These sources include public records, publicly available information, subscription information, warranty cards, surveys, point-of-sale information, website directories, website visits, online activity, mobile applications, and commercially available consumer data from other third-party information providers who may or may not have collected the data directly from you.

Some of this information may have been modeled or inferred from other information. For example, if you subscribe to a bridal magazine we might assume (i.e., infer) that you are engaged to be married. Or, the provider of information might make a calculated estimate of your home’s value based on the known values of surrounding homes (i.e., modeling). We may also use personal data to construct a non-existent “average consumer” that encompasses certain average characteristics of consumers who buy or do not buy (i.e., profiling). Inferring, modeling, and profiling are common practices used in trying to match consumers with products and services they are most likely to want when exact information is not available or feasible.

Identifiers such as name, address, and telephone numbers are sourced from publicly accessible sources such as the white and yellow page telephone directories, online directories, website postings, public records, public websites, property and assessor files, governmental issued licenses, and information available to the public through directory assistance.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
