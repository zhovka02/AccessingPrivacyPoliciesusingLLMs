We and third parties that we authorize may use the following Tracking Technologies on the Service and Digital Properties:\n\nCookies\nA cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s Device. We may place cookies on your Device(s), which may last only during a single session or may be persistent over multiple sessions over time. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and Digital Properties and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Service and Digital Properties, for marketing, to personalize and enhance your user experience, and other purposes described below.\n\nWeb Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”)\nWeb beacons are small graphic images, also known as “tracking pixels,” “Internet tags,” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service and Digital Properties, facilitate marketing, to monitor how users navigate the Service and Digital Properties, and to count content views.\n\nEmbedded Scripts\nAn embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service and Digital Properties. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server, or from a third party with which we work, and is active only while you are connected to the Service or Digital Properties and deleted or deactivated thereafter.\n\nLocation-Identifying Technologies\nGPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate you (sometimes precisely), or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Service or Digital Properties, your Device location may be tracked by us and third parties. Certain Service or Digital Properties features may access and use information about your Device location (such as based on IP address or GPS, as applicable), or your account information, to suggest certain content, products, or services that may be available to you. Our Service and Digital Property content may be personalized based on various information we may have about you to try to provide you with more location-relevant content.\n\nDevice Recognition Technologies\nWe may use device recognition technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household) (“Cross-device Data”).\n\nIn-App Tracking Methods\nThere are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs,” or may use “SDKs,” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices. SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile application by third party companies with which we work. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile application, to improve marketing, and collect certain information about the Device and network you use to access our application, such as the advertising identifier associated with your Device and information about how you interact with our application.\n\nDevice and Activity Monitoring Technologies\nWe use technologies such as session replay tools that monitor, and may record, your interactions with the Service and Digital Properties, including without limitation, keystrokes and how you move through and engage with the Service and Digital Properties.
