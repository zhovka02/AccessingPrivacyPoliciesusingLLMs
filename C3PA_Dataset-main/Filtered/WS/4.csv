Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among AT&T affiliatesButton Icon , such as DIRECTV and Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your State Data Rights and Choices.

Other customers can opt out of Identity Verification at att.com/PrivacyChoices.\n\nSharing information with other non-AT&T companies or entities\nThere are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include:\n\nComplying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law.

This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.\nSharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies\nSometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we provide Wi-Fi services.  In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally.

If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy. In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
