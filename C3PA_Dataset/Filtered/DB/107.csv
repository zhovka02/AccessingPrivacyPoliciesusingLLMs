ra3,"What is personal data?\n\nThe definition of personal data (also known as personal information) changes according to the legislative structure that regulates it. In regards to European Legislation, more specifically the GDPR (‘General Data Protection Regulation), personal data is any data that can be used to ‘identify’ an individual. The definition could include anything from name, email address, passwords, usernames and can span right down to cookies or device identifiers. \n\n\n\nWhat personal data does Blis collect?\n\nWe use cookies, mobile identifiers, tags, pixels, beacons, SDKs and other tracking technology to associate your usage data with you – or more accurately, with your device.  The personal data we hold about you is associated with a unique and pseudonymous identifier linked to your device.  We do not associate that identifier with your name, email, address, or phone number, because we don’t collect that type of directly identifying information about consumers.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
