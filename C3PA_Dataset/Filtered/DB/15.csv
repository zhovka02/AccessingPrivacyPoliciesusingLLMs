Your Access and Choices: You may have the following rights in relation to your personal data:

Rectify any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you;
Have your personal data erased under certain circumstances;
Have the processing of your personal data restricted where you dispute its accuracy, if you think its processing is unlawful, if you otherwise object to its processing, or when we no longer need your personal data and you need it in relation to a legal claim;
Have access to your personal data, and the right to receive copies of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transfer those copies to another data controller, under certain circumstances;
Complain to your national data protection regulator if you feel that any of your personal information is not being processed in accordance with the GDPR.
To exercise your rights to access, rectify or erase your personal data, you can submit a request at aritygdpr.consumerprivacyinfo.com. 

Use of your Personal Data for Analytics and Profiling: We use your personal data to assist in our development of predictive driving models. We may profile your personal data only for the purposes of creating a driving score (“Driving Score”), which is used for our analytics purposes to develop and validate our predictive driving models.  To develop our predictive driving models we gather information about your driving behaviors, such as speed, change in speed, and other aspects of how much, where and when you drive to predict driving risk.  These driving behaviors may be combined with other demographic or geographic information about driving risk for certain locations, which incorporate relative risks.

However, we take steps to remove all personal data that is not necessary to the predictive driving models. So, while your Driving Score incorporates your GPS location data, it will not be directly connected to your name, contact information, or vehicle information unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so in advance.

In addition, we do not do any of the following without obtaining your prior explicit consent to do so:

Use personal data or Driving Scores to make automated decisions that have significant effects for individuals, because individuals are not identifiable within the data set;
Use any insights, model output, or Driving Scores with personal data for any purpose other than internal analytics or our predictive driving models; or
Use your profile or Driving Score to advertise to you.
After pseudonymizing the Driving Scores, we may share the pseudonymized Driving Scores with business clients. Please refer to the business client’s privacy notices for the products and services you have elected to use for details about their privacy practices.  Other than sharing pseudonymized Driving Scores with business clients, we do not share Driving Scores with third parties, unless we are required pursuant to lawful legal process.

Your Driving Score will in no way impact the availability or your use of our products or services.

Your Right to Withdraw Consent: If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing the relevant personal data except to the extent we have other grounds for processing under applicable laws. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. You may withdraw your consent at any time; however, Arity will not be able to provide or continue to provide products or services to you.

There may be cases where restrictions on the amount of data that can be disclosed to data subjects under applicable law (for example, if that would necessarily involve disclosing data about another person). Arity is permitted to withhold some types of personal data in certain circumstances, subject to applicable local law requirements. If there is a dispute, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Us” section. In addition, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. The name and contact details of the supervisory authorities in the European Union can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
