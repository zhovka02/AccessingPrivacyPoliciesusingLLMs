With Our Customers:  Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help them to market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers. We license the Information in various ways to our customers (and something to partners and resellers, who license the Information to their customer), when we provide our Services.

ra2,"4. Your Marketing and Opt-Out Choices
There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you:

First, you may contact us directly to have your personal information removed from our database via our website privacy portal located at Form.  When you do this, please provide your current address, your email address, and any prior home or email addresses you would like “opted out” of our marketing databases.   Or if you prefer, you can contact us directly by Email or mail, at:
Attn:  Privacy

Anteriad, LLC

2 International Drive, Suite 300,

Rye Brook, NY 10573, USA

Email: privacy@Anteriad.com

We will then in most cases remove your personal information from our active marketing databases within 30 business days, from the time we received the opt-out request.  We may in certain cases (but not in most cases) require that you verify any of the information that you submit, such as through a verified email response or another verified response.

If you would like to opt-out of direct mail advertising in general, we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at dmachoice.thedma.org. The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. 
If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising), you can also visit the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages.  Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike Anteriad’s direct opt-out.  Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.  Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you.

Cookies and How We Use Them
Anteriad its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functioning technologies, which we describe below. (We and/or our service providers use these technologies on our website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.)

We may work with third parties or service providers to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form.   These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.

Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a  unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.  When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.  Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.  When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given  website visit.

We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.   Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.

Sometimes, we work with companies that link our Audience Segments to cookies (as also described in Section 2), in order to help companies better target (or suppress) advertisements to consumers.   This is one of type of the various categories of advertising that are often referred to as “personalized” or “interest-based” advertising” or “Interest-Based Advertising.”   You can opt out of this type of advertising through the industry opt-out methods described in Section 3, which are cookie-based.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra2,"12. The GDPR and Your Choices and Access Rights With Respect to Personal Data
If you are a resident of one of many European countries, including the United Kingdom, an important European privacy law (or an equivalent counterpart) the General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) provides you with certain rights, and places certain obligations on companies, regarding how your “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) is used.  We describe those rights and obligations below, and how and in what circumstances we honor them.  (Please only rely on this Section 11 if you are in fact a resident of such a country – it will not apply otherwise.)

Legal Basis. The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we’re relying on to process any “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) about you. The legal grounds for us processing your personal data for the purposes set out in Section 2 above will typically be because:

You provided your (legally sufficient) consent;
It is necessary for our contractual relationship, e.g., in order to provide you services or features you’ve requested and we’ve promised;
The processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations – for instance, to communicate with you about or to help honor your legal rights; and/or
The processing is in our legitimate interest. For instance, we may process and share business data (such as a person’s business email or address and job title) in order to assist our customers to send relevant business-related communications. (As an example, if you are a technology attorney, we might help a privacy foundation or legal association send you an invitation to a privacy law conference by providing or validating for them your most recent contact information.)   
Your rights. Your rights to access, correct, delete or withdraw consent. right to request access to a copy of your personal data, or request that we correct or “rectify,” restrict or delete Your personal data, You may exercise these rights by contacting us at privacy@Anteriad.com or through our website privacy portal located at Form. If you request that we delete your personal data, or withdraw your consent, we will customarily retain a copy of your data sufficient to suppress it from our active databases in the future:  but if that is not what you wish, you may indicate that to us (in which case your information may be added to our database later, because we will not have “suppressed” it).

Moreover, when we delete your personal data, we may retain it (to the extent legal permissible) for certain important (but narrow) internal purposes such as legal, compliance, accounting or auditing purposes. Likewise, when you request access to your information, we are required — for privacy and other important compliance reasons — to verify your identity in a legally sufficient manner: if we cannot do so, we will not be able to satisfy your access request.

Personalized Online Advertising Opt Outs has been amended to the following: Personalized Online Advertising Opt-Outs. You may object to profiling by online advertising platforms with whom we sometimes partner to help generate (and measure or analyze) “personalized” online advertising. These platforms are generally separate third party “controllers” of your data. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may then be inaccessible or not function properly. To opt-out of our collection and use of data for online interest-based advertising on your browser (including a mobile browser if third-party cookies are enabled in your browser) from companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. To opt out of advertising solutions that tailor ads shown within mobile apps based on your likely interests, please either set the preference on your mobile device to limit ad tracking or download the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices app and configure it to opt out of any Digital Advertising Alliance participating company. For more information on this and to opt out, please visit www.policies.google.com/privacy, www.adssettings.google.com/ or www.optout.networkadvertising.org/.

If you are located in the European Union or European Economic Area, you can also opt-out via the IAB Europe’s industry opt-out at www.youronlinechoices.eu.To opt-out of the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising on your mobile device, you can also modify the settings on your mobile device. Please note that after choosing to opt-out via any of the methods above, if you use a different device or a different browser, or if you delete browser cookies, you may need to repeat the opt-out steps for that particular device or browser. In addition, if you block cookies on your browser or if third-party cookies are blocked by default, some of the opt-out tools above may not function.

You may unsubscribe from marketing and other communications that we may send (on behalf of ourselves or others) by clicking the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer of those emails.

Questions or Concerns.  If you have a complaint or concern or question about how we handle your personal data, please contact us as at the above contact addresses, and we will seek to address any concerns you may have.  If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.

When We are a Processor. EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organisations that process personal data on behalf of other organisations (known as “data processors”).   Anteriad sometimes acts as a data controller (for instance, when we make decisions about the data that comprises our own datasets) and sometimes acts as a processor (for instance, when we ingest information that belongs to a customer, such as a “CRM” file that we help analyze).   We generally are only able to help data subjects exercise their rights as to data we are a data controller of.   If you have a question or request as to data we’re a processor of, you should generally address that to the relevant data controller.

13. Privacy Shield/Transfer of Your Information?
On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated Privacy Shield as a Transfer Mechanism for data between EU and US companies. Anteriad intends to utilize the alternate transfer mechanism of Standard Contractual Clauses going forward for data transfers. Even though Privacy Shield was invalidated, Anteriad will continue to honor its commitments with respect to EU personal data transferred pursuant to Privacy Shield before July 16, 2020.

Anteriad LLC (referred to herein as “Anteriad,” “we,” “us,” or “our” as applicable), has created this Privacy Shield Privacy Notice to help you understand how we are subject to and comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. These frameworks are established by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (“EU”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), and Switzerland to the United States. Anteriad has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

Anteriad is committed to educating individuals, our clients, and employees in the United States and in the EU, the UK, and Switzerland about the issues, guidelines and laws surrounding compliance with Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.

Scope
Anteriad collects, stores, transfers, and processes Personal Data in accordance with applicable data protection law, including where it is necessary to provide our Premium Services, to perform the Terms of Use, or to perform obligations under contract. We may transfer your information to affiliates, partners and other third parties as described herein. We will protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.

The type of Personal Data transferred to Anteriad from the EU, the UK and Switzerland pursuant to Privacy Shield consists of Personal Data from clients in the EU, the UK and Switzerland that Anteriad processes on behalf of its clients, such as end-user name, address, email and transaction information. Since the requirements for compliance with Privacy Shield vary depending on whether we are acting as a Processor on behalf of our clients or as a Controller, our policies and manner of compliance are described separately below.

The practices we employ under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, as outlined also apply to data transferred from Switzerland to the United States in compliance with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Anteriad will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles for as long as it retains such data.

Purposes of Data Processing
Anteriad acts as a data processor with respect to Personal Data we receive from our clients and process such information only under the instruction of our clients and are controlled by our clients in the EU, the UK and/or Switzerland. In this capacity, we do not own or control any of the information we process on behalf of our clients. All such information is owned and controlled by our clients. In this capacity, we receive information transferred from the EU, the UK and Switzerland to the United States merely as a Processor on behalf of our clients.

Before starting any processing on behalf of our clients, we enter into a processing contract with the Controller that ensures the Controller is in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) or Member State Data Protection law that may apply. The processing contract will also specify that the processing will be carried out with appropriate data security measures. We have measures in place designed to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Any data processed by us will not be further disclosed to third parties except where permitted or required by the processing contract, Privacy Shield, GDPR, or the applicable Member State Data Protection law. Any information our client (acting as the Controller) identifies as sensitive, will be treated accordingly.

When Anteriad provides business and consumer information products, we act as a Controller of the Personal Data contained in the information products. As a Controller, we share Personal Data with third parties that fall into various categories: clients, vendors and partners. Our clients include but not limited to financial, retail, insurance, and automotive companies.  Our vendors include data suppliers and service providers. We also share Personal Data with partners such as other data resellers for marketing purposes. When we act as a Controller of Personal Data, the policies outlined apply to all Personal Data that has been transferred from the EU, the UK or Switzerland to the United States.

Anteriad and its affiliates located in the EU, the UK or Switzerland, develop and maintain Personal Data on data subjects, households, and businesses located throughout EU Member States, the UK or Switzerland. This information is obtained from public records, publicly available information, information acquired through information providers, and information collected directly from data subjects.

This information is provided to qualified businesses for marketing, customer data integration, and connectivity purposes. This information may also be used to provide information services, enhance the understanding a company has about its customers, aid in accurate integration of a company’s customer information, and be used as lists for direct marketing purposes.

Notice
We may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Prior to the transfer of Personal Data from the EU, the UK or Switzerland to the United States, we require contractual confirmation from the Controller from whom we acquired the information that the Personal Data has been provided to us in accordance with GDPR, Privacy Shield, or the applicable EU Member State Data Protection law, thereby ensuring the data subjects have been provided with proper notice regarding how their Personal Data will be used. In addition, when Personal Data is collected directly from data subjects, we provide the data subject with notice regarding the manner and circumstances in which the Personal Data will be used and transferred to third parties.

Choice
We provide choices and means for individuals to limit the use of their Personal Data. In addition to providing individuals with choices regarding our use of their information, we will remove an individual’s name and related information from our direct marketing information products if they request it. Consumers may request an opt-out form by writing Anteriad at the address below, sending an e-mail to us at privacy@Anteriad.com or via a Form.

Onward Transfer
Since we share Personal Data with third parties as referenced above, we comply with the notice and choice principles as described above for all data disclosed or transferred to a third party. We take reasonable and appropriate steps designed to ensure that the third party effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Principles.

When we use data processors to perform processing tasks on our behalf and at our direction and instruction, we require our data processors either:

Subscribe to the Privacy Shield (in the case of US-based processors), comply with the General Data Protection Regulations (in the case of EU, UK or Switzerland -based processors), or another adequacy finding (in the case of processors in countries outside the US, EU, UK, or Switzerland); or
Enter into a written agreement with us requiring the data processor(s) to process the data only for limited and specified purposes and to provide the same level of protection as Anteriad
In cases of onward transfer to third parties, we may be liable for the acts of the third party that are in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.",Others

ra2,"A. Right to “opt-out” of the sale of your personal information
California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines what constitutes a “sale” – including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration.”

Depending what information we have about you, and whether we have included any of it in our marketing products and services, we may have sold (as defined by California law) certain categories of information about you in the last 12 months, as described in the above table in Section II of this Addendum, titled OUR DISCLOSURE AND SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.",Description of Right to Opt-out of sale of PI
ra2,"C. Right to request deletion of your personal information
As explained further in Section (D) below, you may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from , such as if you have been a customer of ours.  (Note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described below; also note that we do not generally collect personal information directly from consumers.)  However, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.  Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.  If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.",Description of Right to Delete
ra2,"D. How to exercise your access, and (if applicable) deletion rights
Access:  California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by sending an email to privacy@Anteriad.com, submitting their removal request through our form, or by contacting us at 1-800 368 7602.

Because it is required by California law (and also, for security purposes), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you or by requesting you demonstrate possession of a particular identification method (such as an email account) — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of such an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.

Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:

Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.
Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern to doing so.
Deletion:  Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out” or a “deletion”: because “opt out” or “do not sell” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes – i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future (which is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur), we try to explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences.  (In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information that we have collected “from” consumers – which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.)",Methods to exercise rights
ra2,"E. Right to nondiscrimination
We do not deny to you, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services to you, if you choose to exercise these rights.",Description of Right to Non-discrimination on exercising rights
ra2,"F. Information about persons under the age of 16
We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so. If we learn that personal information from such California residents has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent).",Others
ra2,"G. Authorized agents
You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a legally sufficient power of attorney.  We likewise may require that you verify your own identity, depending on the type of request you make.",Methods to exercise rights
