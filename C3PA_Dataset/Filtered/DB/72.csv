ra1,"There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you:

First, you may visit our opt-out page at https://app.retention.com/optout to have your personal information removed from our database. We will then in most cases remove your personal information from our active marketing databases within 15 business days, from the time we received the opt-out request. We may in certain cases (and where legally permissible) require that you verify any of the information that you submit, such as through a verified email response or another verified response.
If you would like to opt-out of email marketing from a particular brand (such as a customer of ours), click on the “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer (at the bottom) of the marketing email you have received.
While we generally do not engage in “direct mail” marketing, some of our customers and partners may. If you are interested in opting our of this type of marketing — i.e., materials received in your physical mailbox — we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at thedma.org. The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. 
To opt out of our Retargeting Services described in section 2, go to and click on the “Opt Out” bar on that page. You will need to do that from each browser that you use (because the retargeting and thus the “opt out” are cookie-based), and if you clear your browser cookies you will need to opt out again.
