The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website(s) (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google and Logiq’s business partners will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website(s) or our services, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google and Logiq’s business partners may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s or Logiq’s business partners’ behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. At this time we do not respond to browser ‘Do Not Track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted. By using this Website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google and Logiq’s business partners in the manner and for the purposes set out above. Web Beacons Some of our Website(s) may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. These images allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personal data, but they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about our Website usage. Web beacons used on our Website(s) collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Some of our Website(s) may also contain web beacons placed there to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Third Party Advertising The ads appearing on Website(s) are delivered to users by third party advertisers including Google, among others. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These Website(s) allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you and other Internet users visit. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third-party web beacon to collect this information. Log Files Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement. Legal Disclosures Logiq may need to disclose personal information when required by law or legal process. Logiq may also share information when it has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary: to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Logiq or any of its Affiliates; to prevent fraud or other illegal activity; to prevent imminent bodily harm; or, to protect Logiq and users from people violating this Privacy Policy or Terms of Use. Business Transitions In the event Logiq goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, or if Logiq declares bankruptcy, Logiq may transfer your personal information as part of the assets transferred. Data Retention Logiq will retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the services that you have requested, comply with any laws or regulations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
