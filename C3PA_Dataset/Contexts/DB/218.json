YOUR PRIVACY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US. Multimedia Lists is located at: Multimedia Lists 46 Park Avenue N. Asheville, North Carolina 28801, United States 256-468-5478 Multimedia Lists, Inc. Data Services and Website Privacy Policy Multimedia Lists, Inc. provides a range of data marketing and consumer analytics products (the “Services”) designed to help both for-profit and not-profit organizations, including marketing companies and platforms and their own clients, to market their goods and services in a relevant and efficient way. Our solutions, many of which are described on this website, are used to help marketing that occurs through direct mail, email, online, connected-TV and other marketing channels. We take seriously the privacy interests of the individuals whose information we receive and share. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe how we use and manage that information, and what rights consumers have to control how their information is used in marketing. In compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, we provide a “CCPA PRIVACY NOTICE” Which describes additional rights you have if you are a California resident. We also operate one or more corporate websites, which are principally designed for our own customers and prospective customers. We address the information we collect and use for those business purposes (such as information we use to communicate with our corporate customers, and potential customers) in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy. Last Updated December 14, 2021 1. Information That We Collect and Use in Our Services When we provide our Services, we receive data, including personal information, from a variety of sources, including websites and mobile apps, public sources, and other data compilers. We refer to the information that we collect and process throughout this Privacy Policy as “Information” or “the Information.” The Information often includes various identifying and demographic information about individuals. It often includes personal attributes such as name, address and other contact information. It may also include information (on the individual, household, or geographic level level), such as: •Professional information, including occupation and job title •Particular interests, such as (for instance) home improvement, music,online shopping, health and beauty sport, or travel, or political leanings •Organizations to which you belong or have belonged, such as a cyclingclub, or to which you have contributed •Publicly available information, such as that available from governmentinformation and files •Demographic information, such as age, gender, level of education orlikely income range This type of information may be inferred – for instance, if a household is in a particularly wealthy area, we might infer a particular income range; if a person’s name is “Catherine” we might infer gender as likely female. Multimedia Lists, Inc. also receives information through this website (and any other website we operate). We describe this information in Section 6. 2. How We Use the Information Multimedia Lists, Inc. uses the Information for various purposes, including the following. As Part of Our Services: •Data Marketing Services: Our Services include providing marketinginformation to our customers, generally regarding which customers orprospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested)in certain offers, or how to best contact or identify those customers.Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand theircustomers better, by providing insights about them. Our customersinclude (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and variousmarketing data platforms that help them to market and advertise to theirown customers (and prospective customers); our customers alsoinclude other data compilers, who work with their own customers. •Online Targeting: We sometimes create defined audience segments(“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared(actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with healthcare professionals, or with an interest in international travel). When wedo this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Informationthrough de-identification techniques (such as through coded data“hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to targetand measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile andother media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of thisand other online ad targeting in Section 4. •Identity Products: We sometimes use the Information we collect tocreate (or to help our customers create) “identity” graphs, to help locateusers across various channels, such as based on common personal,device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, emailaddress). •Additional Marketing Services: Other Services we may sometimesprovide to our customers (or that they may provide to their owncustomers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, mayinvolve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, emailcampaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring howeffective marketing campaigns have been, by determining whichmessages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types ofconsumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases;(c)analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’)proprietary databases, or helping customers to detect and prevent crime and fraud; or (d) providing “validation” or data hygiene services, which is how companies update and/or correct their databases by verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information. To Operate Our Services: We also use the Information for our own internal purposes – such as to improve, test, update and verify our own database; to develop new products; and to operate, analyze, improve and secure our Services and our databases and servers. 3.How We Share Information with Customers, Third Parties, including Service Providers Multimedia Lists, Inc. may share the Information with customers, marketing services and platforms, as well as service providers that help us to provide the Services we’ve described above (or other services we may add in the future). This includes sharing in the following ways: •With Our Customers: As described above, we license the Informationin various ways to our customers (and something to partners andresellers, who license the Information to their customer), when weprovide our Services. We may sometimes share the Information withthose Customers’ service providers (for instance, a provider that printsor sends mailings for a Customer), or ad agencies that they work with. •With Our Partners: We also may share the Information, includingpersonally identifiable information and Audience Segments, withbusiness and data partners to help provide more tailored targetedmarketing, advertising and communications. Likewise, we may do so foranalytical purposes, including to help these other parties measurecampaign performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze,or segregate this Information on our or our customers’ behalf. •With Our Service Providers: We share the Information with a varietyof service providers in order to operate, protect and advertise ourServices and maintain our website(s). For instance, we may share theInformation with tech and customer support providers, marketing andadvertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance or verifyour Information), security vendors, payment vendors (as to our businessto business information), and other companies help us deliver ordevelop Services. •Corporate transfers: If Multimedia Lists, Inc., its stock or its significantassets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our informationwill be transferred to that entity, and may be shared during due diligencein anticipation of any such transaction. •Affiliates, parent companies and subsidiaries: Multimedia Lists, Inc.may share some or all of the Information in our possession with anyaffiliated or subsidiary companies (if we ever have any). •As required by law or to protect any person or entity: MultimediaLists, Inc. may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure isnecessary to (a) comply in good faith with relevant laws or to respond tosubpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwisedefend the rights, property or safety of Multimedia Lists, Inc., ourcustomers, or any other person or entity. 4.Your Marketing and Opt-Out Choices There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you: •First, if you would like to opt out, you may follow the link at thebottom of our website or click here: “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” to have your personal information removed from ourdatabase. When you do this, you’ll be asked to provide your name,current address, and, optionally, your email address. We may in certaincases require that you verify any of the information that you submit,such as through a verified email response or another verified response. •If you would like to opt-out of direct mail advertising in general, werecommend that you visit the DMA Choice website,at dmachoice.thedma.org . The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow a few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. • If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising), you can visit the opt-out portals operated by the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages. Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based. Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again. Opting-out in this manner will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you. (If your browser is set to reject cookies, or to reject third party cookies, these opt-out solutions may not work, or may have limited duration.) • If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – for instance, if you are a customer or prospective customer of ours and we send information about our Services — you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails. 5. Cookies and Similar Technologies Cookies and How We Use Them Multimedia Lists, Inc. and its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functioning technologies, which we describe below. (We and/or our service providers use these technologies on our website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.) We may work with third parties or service providers to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form. These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies. Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device. When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit. We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see. Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests. Disabling Cookies Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies (particularly “first party” cookies). You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our website and other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable. 6.Data Collected Through Our Corporate Website Information Collected Multimedia Lists, Inc. collects information from users of our website(s) (including any page on which this Privacy Policy is posted), including: •The domain name and IP address of a user’s web browser, along with atimestamp and other information about a user’s browser or device. •Information about what content and pages users access, utilize or visiton our website, or how they interact with our content – for instance, ifthey spent a certain amount of time reviewing a particular blog post ordescription of particular services. •Information, including personally identifiable and contact informationthat you provide, which could include (for instance) survey information,sign-up information (e.g., if you sign up for events or newsletters),requests for information, mailing addresses and email addresses.

This may include various types of physical and electronic security, including firewall protections, encryption, hashing or truncation of data, and access controls to personal information. While neither we nor any platform can guarantee 100 percent safety from hacks or illegal intrusion, we employ efforts we believe are designed to ensure that this does not occur. 9. Changes to this Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to it will become effective when it is posted to our website. Please check back to learn of any changes to this Privacy Policy if you are interested in our privacy practices. 10.

If you have questions related to this Privacy Policy, or regarding our products or services, please contact us: Privacy Officer Multimedia Lists, Inc. 46 Park Avenue ASHEVILLE, NC 28801 Compliance@Multimedialists.com We appreciate your comments and questions regarding Multimedia Lists, Inc.’s privacy practices. Addendum for California Residents – California Privacy Rights CCPA PRIVACY NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS [CONSUMERS] – CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT RIGHTS The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides certain rights to residents of California. This section of the Privacy Policy applies if you are a natural person who is a resident of California (“California Consumer”) and uses our Services. This Addendum supplements the information in the Privacy Policy. However, this Addendum is intended solely for, and is applicable only to, California Consumers: if you are not a California Consumer (or a resident of California), the below does not apply to you and you should not rely on it. In the below tables and sections, we describe (as required by the CCPA): 1. Our Collection of Personal Information – the types of Personal Information (which the CCPA defines broadly) that we collect, the types of sources we collect it from. 2. Our Disclosure and Sale of Personal Information – the types of recipients to whom we disclose or sell Personal Information. 3. Our Business Purposes – our business purposes for (a) collecting and (b) sharing Personal Information, which are generally the same. 4. Your California Privacy Rights and Choices – what rights you have under the CCPA, for instance, to request that we “opt out” your information from our marketing database (also called “do not sell” rights), or to request categories and personal information that we may have collected about you. Sometimes, we act only as a “service provider” to our clients (for instance, if they provide information to us for analytics, processing or other data management services), in which case any consumer requests for opt-out, deletion or access to data must be made through that client: we therefore will forward any such requests to a named client, as feasible. The following sets forth the categories of information we collect and purposes for which we may use California Consumers’ personal information: 1. Our Collection of Personal Information Depending on how you interact with us, we may collect about you the categories of information summarized in the table below. The following table also describes how we collect and use such categories of information. Category Categories of Sources Identifiers E.g., name; alias; postal address; mobile ad identifiers; IP address; telephone number; email address; social network handles Data compilers and consumer data resellers, informational and retail websites, as well as non-profit organizations (“Commercial Source Categories”) Public records and other publicly available sources Government entities Social networks Characteristics of protected classifications under California or US law (inferenced or actual, including self-reported) E.g., race; color; religion; sex/gender; pregnancy, marital status; military or veteran status; national origin; ancestry; age (over 40) (may be inferenced, actual or self-reported) Commercial Source Categories Public records and other publicly available sources Government entities Social networks Commercial or transactions information E.g., products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

Commercial Recipient Categories Advertising networks and media platforms, political campaigns, internet service providers, data analytics providers Social networks Yes We also may share any of the personal information we collect as follows: • Sharing for Legal Purposes: In addition, we may share personal information with third parties in order to: (a) comply with legal process or a regulatory investigation (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of us, our platform, our customers, our agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. We likewise may provide information to other companies and organizations (including law enforcement) for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes. • Sharing In Event of a Corporate Transaction: We may also share personal information in the event of a major corporate transaction, including for example a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets, or for purposes of due diligence connected with any such transaction. • Sharing With Service Providers: We share any personal information we collect with our service providers, which may include (for instance) providers involved in tech or customer support, operations, web or data hosting, billing, accounting, security, marketing, data management, validation, enhancement or hygiene, or otherwise assisting us to provide, develop, maintain and improve our services. • Sharing of Aggregate Information: We may aggregate and/or de-identify any information collected so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors, at our discretion. 3. Our Business Purposes for Collecting and Sharing Personal Information Generally speaking, we collect and share the Personal Information that we collect for the following purposes, as we also have described in our Privacy Policy and/or our website. Our Purposes for collecting, using and sharing Personal Information: Data marketing services, for example: • Generally, creating data marketing tools and products for our marketer clients, as more fully described in our Privacy Policy (and on our websites). This includes our provision of datasets, data “appends” (connecting data across datasets), data “scoring” (providing inferences about potential consumer behavior), data hygiene services (helping customers to evaluate, validate and correct personal information they hold), and security and anti-fraud services (helping customers to identify potentially fraudulent activity). • Helping our Clients identify and understand their consumers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs, as well as providing financial and other scoring products. • Assisting our Clients through our Services to provide their current and prospective customers with better service, improved offerings, and special promotions, for instance, advising on which current or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers. Online targeting, for example: • Creating or helping to create defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students). When we do this, we work with a data partner that “matches” our or other Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. • Assisting Clients in creating “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address). Additional marketing services, for example (which may overlap with “data marketing services” above): • Assisting in targeting and optimizing direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing. • Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases. • Analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud. • Providing “verification” or data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information. Operating our Services, for example: • Improving, testing, updating and verifying our own database. • Developing new products. • Operating, analyzing, improving, and securing our Services. Other internal purposes, for example: • For internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance. We sometimes use the information collected from our own website, from social networks, from other “business to business” interactions (such as at trade shows) or from data compilers for the above, as well as for our own marketing purposes. 4. Your California Rights and Choices California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions and without being discriminated against for exercising these rights. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests. (To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.) A. Your right to “opt out” of the sale of your personal information California residents have the right to opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines what constitutes a “sale” – including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration.” If you would like to opt out, you may follow the link at the bottom of our website or click here: “Do Not Sell My Personal Information ” . You may also call our toll-free number at 1-800-239-5478, but we highly recommend using the website link for the most straightforward and efficient processing. The “opt-out” action effectively removes all information from our files, and places your information on a “suppression” list. We will only retain enough to ensure your information is not reintroduced. B. Right to request access to your personal information (Right to Know) California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information. Sometimes, we act only as a “service provider” to our clients (for instance, if they provide information to us for analytics, processing or other data management services), in which case any consumer requests for opt-out, deletion or access to data must be made through that client: we therefore will forward any such requests to a named client, as feasible. California residents may exercise their California access rights by going to our Privacy Portal within the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page. You may also submit a request by calling our toll-free number at 1-800-239-5478, but we highly recommend accessing our website for the most straightforward and efficient processing. For security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California access rights. For instance, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier, identifying information, or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be. Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate: • Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories. • Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern to doing so. • Upon completion of the above process, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information we were able to locate about you, whether we (1) deleted, (2) de-identified, or (3) retained the information we collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request. C. Right to request deletion of your personal information You may also request that we “delete” any personal information that we collected directly from you, such as if you are a customer of ours, or interacted with us at a trade show. California residents may exercise their California deletion rights by going to our Privacy Portal within the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information ” page. You may also call our toll-free number at 1-800-239-5478. We highly recommend using the website link for the most straightforward and efficient processing. However, ‘deletion” is different from “opting out” of sale (or exercising your “do not sell” rights), as it only pertains to information we collected “from” you – not the data in our commercial database. Thus, if you want to avoid being placed in our database in the future, and avoid having your data “sold” to marketers, then you should exercise your “opt out” rights, described in section A above and on our “Do Not Sell My Personal Informati on” page: we will then maintain your information on a suppression list, to “suppress” your data if we later acquire it. Also note that when we “delete” your information (e.g., if you are a former customer of ours), we may (and are permitted to) retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to ensure your deleted information is not reintroduced to our systems, (b) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (c) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as debugging purposes), (d) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (e) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (f) for scientific or historical research, (g) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. D. Right to Nondiscrimination We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights. E. Information about persons under the age of 16 We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so.
