Milestone Marketing Solutions Privacy Policy ​ Welcome to the official website of Milestone Marketing Solutions (“Milestone” or “we”).  Milestone is committed to protecting the privacy of the information obtained as a result of its commercial activities and complying with all applicable laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data.  We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of the personal data or personal information we may collect from you or from other sources and how we may use and share that information.  If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at privacy@milestonemarketingsolutions.com . ​ Milestone is the owner of the information collected on this website.  Milestone also purchases and licenses information for use in the course of its business and resells that data to its customers.  Our privacy policy does not apply to third-party services or the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including other companies with whom you might interact through our website or the companies from which we purchase or license information. ​ For a description of the rights of California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and our handling of the Personal Information of California residents, please see the section titled “Privacy Rights for California Residents” below. ​ We do not market to, or control or process the data of, non-United States residents.  We do not market to, or control or process the data of, individuals under the age of eighteen (18).  If you are under the age of 18 or a non-US resident, you should not use this website or provide your information to Milestone. ​ By using our website, you consent to our online Privacy Policy. ​ What Personal Information We Collect and Use: “Personal Information” or “personal data” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.  Milestone generally purchases, licenses, collects, uses, and/or resells demographic data (name, address, and automobile information).  Milestone also occasionally purchases, licenses, collects, uses, and/or resells other categories of information (e.g., loan, household, or political and religious affiliation).  For additional details on what Personal Information we purchase, license, collect use, and resell, please consult the section below “Privacy Rights for California Residents.” ​ “Process” or “processing” means any operation which is performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, acquisition, holding, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. ​ Milestone purchases, licenses, collects, uses, retains, and processes – for as long as is reasonably necessary to satisfy the purpose of its collection – such information as is needed to (i) deliver the services ordered by Milestone’s customers; (ii) memorialize the contractual terms on which we supply services; (iii) process and invoice the services; (iv) respond to customer questions or requests; (v) provide access to certain areas and features of this website; (v) tailor content, publications, advertisements, and offers we believe may be of interest; (vi) test, research, analyze, and develop products; (vii) protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our clients, or others; and (viii) improve the website and Milestone’s systems. ​ Sharing of Personal Information Milestone may share Personal Information with advertisers and other third-parties, including our customers and vendors.  The other parties with whom we share Personal Information may send information to you about their products or services.  These business partners are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf, as authorized under the terms of our agreements with them, or to comply with legal requirements.  They also agree to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information and to assure it is not unlawfully accessed and misused. ​ We may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, court order or legal process; (ii) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (iii) under the discovery process in litigation or arbitration; (iv) to enforce Milestone policies, contracts, or other rights; (v) to collect amounts owed to Milestone; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) if in good faith we believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. ​ In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on this website.  In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities. ​ We also use the information we have and collect through this website to help advertisers and other partners measure the effectiveness and distribution of their ads and services, and understand the types of people who use their services and how people interact with their website, apps, and services.   Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use for this function.  You can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics . ​ We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of Milestone or of any of our assets (including should Milestone cease to operate, become insolvent, enter into receivership or any similar event occur).  Should such an event take place, we will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you believe your Personal Information is incorrect or you no longer wish it to be shared or used by Milestone, you can email us at privacy@milestonemarketingsolutions.com . ​ Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: When you visit this website, we collect certain information by automated means to help us improve our website and provide customized services and information.  Like many companies, we collect this information through the use of cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies.  Cookies and web beacons are small text files that are downloaded and stored to your computer’s memory and hard drive when you visit certain websites.  Some cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser or after a short period (temporary cookies), while others can be stored longer on your computer, sometimes until you delete them manually (persistent cookies). ​ Milestone collects information through cookies and web beacons about your web browsing activities.  For example, we may use cookies to collect information about your website activity or to determine whether you are an existing or new visitor to our website.  Milestone may use the information collected from cookies and web beacons to optimize your experience on this website, to improve our services and products, for research and modeling, and for the management and security of this website.  Our website utilizes both temporary and persistent cookies to enhance your online experience. ​ We currently set the following cookies: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ If you wish to restrict, block, or delete the cookies that are set by our website, you can do so using your browser settings.  Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether to accept them and how to disable existing cookies. You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a new cookie. Please note that some features of the website may not function properly or may be slower without cookies.  To make full use of the website, your computer or mobile device will need to accept cookies. ​ For more information about cookies and how to remove them on your browser, you can visit www.allaboutcookies.org or these third-party websites: Google Chrome Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Safari Desktop Safari Mobile Android Opera ​ Other tracking technologies may record information.  For example, collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.  Our website does not respond to “do not track” signals.  It is not our practice to link the information we record using cookies or other tracking technologies to any Personal Information you submit through the website.  However, we reserve the right to use cookies and other tracking technologies to identify a visitor. We may do so, for example, when we believe it is necessary to protect this website, our visitors, licensees, or other third parties, or to protect our rights or defend against a claim relating to us, or when we believe that the law requires it. ​ How We Respond to Do Not Track (DNT) Signals: Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. We do not currently respond to DNT signals. Therefore, please be advised that third party web analytics companies may collect information about your online activities over time and across our website and other online properties. ​ Third-Party Websites: This website may on occasion contain links to websites owned and operated by third-parties.  Milestone does not control such third-party websites, the content of those websites, any products or services that may be offered through those websites, or any other use of the linked sites.  Your use of any linked website is solely at your own risk.  To understand what information those websites collect, please review their privacy policies directly. Protection of Information: ​ Milestone takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.  While we strive to always protect our systems, sites, operations and information against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle and other changing risk factors, we cannot always guarantee that any information, during transmission or while stored on our systems, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others. For additional information, please consult our Terms of Use . ​ Children’s Privacy on this Website This website is not intended for use by children under the age of 18.  We do not knowingly collect, purchase, license, or sell the Personal Information from anyone under 18 years of age through this website.  If you are under 18, please do not submit any Personal Information on this website. Privacy Rights for California Residents: California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (Civil Code Sections 1798.100 - 1798.199) grants California residents certain rights regarding the use of their Personal Information.  These rights pertain only to residents of the State of California.  They include: the right to notice that personal information will be collected; the right to know what personal information has been collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose, and to whom it was sold or disclosed; the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information; the right to have your personal information deleted; and the right to non-discrimination as a result of exercising these rights. ​ In particular, we have collected, purchased, licensed, and/or resold the following categories of personal information from consumers or business partners within the last twelve (12) months: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ Personal Information does not include: publicly available information from government records; de-identified or aggregated consumer information; or information excluded from the CCPA’s scope such as health or medical information covered by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  Our uses and sharing of Personal Information are described herein. ​ California residents have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.  If you are a California resident and would like to request additional information about the types of personal data Milestone has collected, purchased, licensed, shared, or resold with third parties, you may email us at privacy@MilestoneMarketingSolutions.com or contact us through one of the additional channels listed below. ​ California residents also have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions.  To the extent Milestone “sells” your Personal Information, you also have the right to opt-out of that sale on a going-forward basis at any time.  If you do not want us to sell your Personal Information, please email us at privacy@milestonemarketingsolutions.com or select the “Do Not Sell My Information” link on our home page. After you opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information, we will no longer “sell” your personal information to third-parties (except in an aggregated or de-identified manner so it is no longer personal information). ​ Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  You must provide: Information sufficient to allow us to reasonably verify your identity and that we have your Personal Information; and Describe your request in sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. ​ Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we may disclose to you: Categories of Personal Information we collected about you; Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information; The categories of third-parties with whom we share that Personal Information; and The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request). ​ If we comply with your request, we will retain a record of it for at least 24 months.  Pursuant to the CCPA, Milestone may deny your request, in whole or in part, pursuant to enumerated exemptions.  If Milestone denies your request, we will inform you of the basis of the denial.  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.  We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. ​ Contact Us: If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, the ways in which we collect and use your Personal Information, your choices and rights regarding such use, or wish to exercise your rights under California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (available to California residents only), please do not hesitate to contact us at: Phone: 1-800-313-1873 Website: www.milestonemarketingsolutions.com Email: privacy@milestonemarketingsolutions.com Postal Address: Milestone Marketing Solutions Att: Dustin Struckman, Chief Data Officer 844 Waterbury Falls Drive, Suite 201 O’Fallon, MO 63368 ​ Changes to This Privacy Policy: We may update or change this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice to you.  We will post a “last modified” date for this Privacy Policy to indicate when it was most recently updated.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on this website. ​ Last Modified: October 22, 2020 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ © 2022 by Milestone Marketing Solutions Terms of Use Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Personal Information FREE QUOTE LEARN MORE TODAY: bottom of page Accept Cookie Settings We use cookies and similar technologies to enable services and functionality on our site and to understand your interaction with our service.
