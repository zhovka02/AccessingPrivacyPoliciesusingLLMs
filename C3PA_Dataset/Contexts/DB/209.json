Personal Data Sent to Lucid By Your Supplier Lucid acts as a Separate and Independent Controller of the Personal Data received by Lucid from your Supplier. Personal Data Sent By Lucid to its Buyers The Personal Data we collect on our Sites pursuant to your opt-in consent may be shared by Lucid with our Buyers, and as such, our Buyers then become Separate and Independent Controllers of that Personal Data.

Personal Data collected via other external third-party hosting platforms may be transferred to Lucid’s Sites in the performance of Marketplace Services.
