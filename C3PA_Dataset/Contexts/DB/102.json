This Privacy Policy describes the Personal Information (as defined below) collected or processed when you interact with our Website, use our Services, if we have purchased or licensed your Personal Information from a third-party, what we do or don’t do with your Personal Data, and your rights with respect to your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy governs your privacy rights. We recommend reading this Privacy Policy in its entirety. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access our Website, use our Services, and ensure to opt-out of our use of your Personal Data. This Privacy Policy is a binding legal agreement. This Privacy Policy applies to all persons and entities who visit our website, www.sterlingstrategies.co (“Website”), use our Services, or if we have purchased or licensed your Personal Information from a third-party. By using our Website, you consent to this Privacy Policy and all subsequent amendments and modifications. It is your duty to monitor all changes, edits, amendments, and modifications. I: What Information is Collected About You The information we may collect about you (“Personal Information”) encompasses a variety of categories. Personal Information is information that identifies you, describes you, relates to you, or can be reasonably linked to you. It includes information that can be directly associated with a specific person, entity, or device such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or IP address. It also includes information about activities that are directly linked to that person, entity, or device. All information we collect from you on/via/through our Website or from our third-party partners or affiliates is defined under “Personal Information”. II: From Where, When, and What Specific Personal Information is Collected Automatic Collection. We automatically receive certain types of Personal Information whenever you interact with us online. For example, when you visit our Website, our systems automatically collect your IP address, physical location, the type of browser you use, the type of computer you are using, computer operating system, type of mobile device and carrier (if applicable), and where you navigated from to reach our Website. Information You Provide. We also collect Personal Information you provide us when you contact us through our Website or when you create an account on our Website. The Personal Information we gather through this would vary, depending on what Personal Information you elect to give us, but the information collected would be identifiers: information identifying you, such as your email, name, phone number, political affiliation, past donor history, past voting history, . Cookies. Personal Information may be automatically collected through the use of “Cookies” or cookie-like files called “Local Shared Objects” (also known as Flash cookies). Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. By continuing to use our Website, you are accepting and consenting to our use of cookies, however you are free to adjust your browser settings to reject cookies and/or actually delete cookies, at your own volition. However, doing either could affect certain features or services on our website. Note that browser settings may not affect Local Shared Objects. III: Why do we collect Personal Information? It helps us optimize the features of our Website and improve your experience. We use Cookies and Local Shared Objects to help us improve your experience, via saving account information so that you don’t have to re-log in all the time, or through saving any preferences you have specified in using the Website. It helps us get a better sense of who accesses our Website and who uses its features. As a data-intensive company, we love monitoring and analyzing data. In this case, the information we may collect could help us understand more about who is using and accessing our Website, which helps us understand more about our audience and the effectiveness of our outreach practices and technologies. Cookies let us count new visitors who come to our Website, giving us a more reliable sense of the traffic our website receives, and IP addresses let us know the general areas from which these visitors come – crucial to understanding the geographic scope of our outreach practices and technologies. It allows us to communicate with you. Collecting your Personal Information permits us to respond to you if you contact us, or to reach out to you if we want or need to contact you. If we do not have your email/phone number/name, then we cannot contact you, which would be problematic if we needed to, especially if we needed to respond to a question you had posed. We may also use your Personal Information or non-Personal Information for other purposes consistent with our business, except when not permitted by applicable law. IV: With Whom Could Personal Information be Shared? Inside our Company. Personal Information collected may be seen by our employees, agents, or related persons who need to see it to perform related functions as specified in this Policy, or as made apparent by reason. Third Parties. We may share your Personal Information with persons or entities outside of our Company (“Third Party” or “Third-Parties”), including, without limitation, the foregoing reasons: To Carry Out Your Requests. We may be required to disclose Personal Information in order to carry out your requests when you use our Website. If you ask us to place you in contact with a Third-Party, we would need to give them your contact information. Additionally, certain actions conducted on our Website may require the use of a Third-Party service to ensure those actions are properly carried out. In those cases, we would give the Third-Party service the Personal Information necessary to carry out that action. For your protection, we require that all Third-Parties we work with have in place industry standard data protection practices. To Protect You and Ourselves. We release Personal Information when we believe that releasing it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena). We also may release Personal Information if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is necessary to combat or address violations of our rights or property, to protect ourselves or our associated persons and entities from violations of their rights or property, or to attempt to prevent or to report to proper authorities any unlawful acts. For our Business Purposes. We may share your Personal Information with third-parties, such as political campaigns, to carry out our regular business purposes, which includes but is not limited to the buying, selling, and licensing of contact information (including some Personal Information) of potential donors for campaign financing and fundraising purposes. For Other Commercial Purposes. We may share Personal Information with third-parties for other commercial purposes, subject to applicable law. For all Other Reasons Permitted by Law. We may share Personal Information with third-parties for all other purposes, subject to applicable law. V: Access to your Information and Right to Opt Out. Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the Personal Information we have collected and maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, and have the Personal Information deleted so that it cannot be sold. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by local law. Further information is in Sections XI to XIII. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We are not obligated to edit, remove, or delete Personal Information if we are unable to verify that you are the person whom we collected Personal Information, if we have reason to believe that you are a bot and not a person, or for any other reason that indicates that you may not be the person from whom we collected Personal Information. If you believe any Personal Information which we have collected is inaccurate or you would like us to delete your Personal Information, please fill out the Form found at the end of this Policy, unless it is information collected through your account, in which case you may change it at will, as you have control over your own account. However, if you feel it is impossible to do so, then you may contact us via the Form, and we will perform the change(s). We will endeavor to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, which may depend on the number of requests we have received at or around the time of your request. If we need additional time, which we reasonably expect to be completed within thirty (30) days, we will contact you in writing and inform you of the reason for the delay. VI: How We Keep Your Data Secure All gathered Personal Information is stored and secured by industry standard security methods; we use tools and safeguards to protect against unauthorized access to our stores of Personal Information, and to ensure reasonable levels of security. But, we do not guarantee that your Personal Information will be protected from any unauthorized access. If you have reason to believe that the security of your Personal Information might have been compromised, please immediately notify us. VII: Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act We do not knowingly, directly or passively, collect information from children under the age of 13. To respect the privacy of children and to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not provide any Personal Information on our Website. We ask that parents supervise their children while online. VIII: Do Not Track Requests Because we do not track the visitors of our Website over time or when they go to Third-Party websites, this Website may not comply with Do-Not-Track requests that you/your browser may send us (as compliance with those requests may necessitate special software which is unnecessary as we never track you anyway). IX: Links To Other Websites Please be aware that we may provide links to third-party websites, including those websites maintained by political candidates/political campaigns, other political organizations or persons, and news media outlets, as a service to our visitors. We are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those websites. Please note that these websites’ privacy policies will differ from ours. We encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices before providing them with any information. X: Updating This Policy This Policy is dynamic, as it may be revised or updated on many occasions, such as if our practices change, if we add new features to this website, or for any other reason we feel would be proper to accommodate any changes in our practices. So, we will make changes to this Policy at will. You should refer back to this page often to ensure you are updated on the latest information about this website’s Privacy Policy. We may not provide or post any notice if the changes that occur are not material, however we will post a notice on our website’s homepage if any material changes are made to this Policy. If any changes of any kind are made to this Policy, the Date of Last Revision, located at the top of this Policy, will be changed. XI: Notice to California Residents The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) affords residents of the State of California the right to know the Personal Information we collect about you and how it is used and shared (“Right to Know”), the right to delete upon request some types of – but not all – Personal Information we have collected about you (“Right to Delete”), the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information (“Right to Opt-Out”), and your right to be fully protected against discrimination from us if you were to exercise any of these rights. This Policy already provides much of what the Act requires under the Right to Know, but to know some things, such as specifically what Personal Information we have collected about you over the past 12 months, as well as to then delete that information, you will need to take specific action by contacting us. To exercise your rights under the CCPA, please fill out the Form found at the end of this Policy. To protect the Personal Information we collect, and the individuals from whom we collect the Personal Information, we may require you to prove you are who you say you are, and that you are a resident of the State of California, before we can conduct your requests. You may have an authorized representative conduct your requests on your behalf, however if you do so we may ask for verification that the representative is authorized by you, and ask you or your representative to prove that you are who you say you are, and that you are a resident of the State of California. Understand that we may deny your requests if we do not believe you have provided sufficient or correct documentation or proof that you are in fact who you say you are, or – if applicable – that your authorized representative is in fact authorized by you to represent you. If this occurs, we are more than willing to figure out a way to ensure that we can verify your identity and ensure that your rights are properly exercised. Evaluating and then responding to CCPA requests is not a simple matter for us to undertake, and therefore we will almost certainly not conduct them for persons who are not California residents. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. We do not and will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. XII: Notice to Nevada Residents Nevada law, specifically Senate Bill 220, allows customers who are residents of the state of Nevada to “opt out” of the sale of certain Personal Information, called “covered information.” You have the right to opt out at any time and direct us not to sell your Personal Information. To exercise your rights under Senate Bill 220, please fill out the Form found at the end of this Policy. We will endeavor to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, which may depend on the number of requests we have received at or around the time of your request. If we need additional time, which we reasonably expect to be completed within thirty (30) days, we will contact you in writing and inform you of the reason for the delay. XIII: Notice to Residents of Europe and the European Union If you are a current resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland (“Covered European Countries”), you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Information, as we have outlined below. For individuals who are located in the Covered European Countries, we rely on legal bases for processing your information under Article 6 of the EU GDPR which can be found here: https://gdpr-info.eu/ . We generally only process your data where: (a) we are legally required to; (b) where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered into with you; (c) for our legitimate interests to operate our business; or (d) or to protect our or your, property, rights, or safety, or where we have obtained your consent to do so. Below is a list of the purposes described in our GDPR Privacy Policy with the corresponding legal bases for processing.

Please ensure you have already read the above Privacy Policy to understand the rights that you may have been granted by the jurisdictions in which you live. In filling out this Form, please provide us with your legal name, and then at least one way by which we can contact you: preferably an email address.

To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level. These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more. This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs. Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments. If you wish to contact the website’s owner please use the website's form Screen-reader and keyboard navigation Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements: Screen-reader optimization: we run a process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website. In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images. It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website. These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Disability profiles supported on our website Epilepsy Safe Profile: this profile enables people with epilepsy to safely use the website by eliminating the risk of seizures resulting from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations. Vision Impaired Profile: this profile adjusts the website so that it is accessible to the majority of visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others. Cognitive Disability Profile: this profile provides various assistive features to help users with cognitive disabilities such as Autism, Dyslexia, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements more easily. ADHD Friendly Profile : this profile significantly reduces distractions and noise to help people with ADHD, and Neurodevelopmental disorders browse, read, and focus on the essential elements more easily. Blind Users Profile (Screen-readers): this profile adjusts the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is installed on the blind user’s computer, and this site is compatible with it. Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired): this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements. Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments Font adjustments – users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more. Color adjustments – users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds with over seven different coloring options. Animations – epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions. Content highlighting – users can choose to emphasize essential elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only. Audio muting – users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly. Cognitive disorders – we utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others. Additional functions – we allow users to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions. Assistive technology and browser compatibility We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users. Notes, comments, and feedback Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements.
