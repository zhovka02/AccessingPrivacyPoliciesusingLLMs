You are a User when you visit a page of a website or app of one of LoopMe’s partners where LoopMe is serving interest based advertising. 1. Who we are and what we do + Who we are LoopMe means LoopMe Limited (company number), a company registered in England and Wales and its affiliated subsidiaries (collectively, “LoopMe,” or “we“, “us“, “our“). We partner with publishers and marketers across the globe. We follow the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles, the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Code of Conduct and we are a member of the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau) in the UK.If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please get in touch using the details in the How to contact us section below. What we do LoopMe is an outcomes-based video platform closing the loop on brand advertising. We work with a number of businesses helping advertisers to promote their products and services to interested audiences by connecting them with websites and apps with space to offer for advertising (these we refer to as publishers). LoopMe helps advertisers to deliver relevant online advertising to visitors (i.e. you) to publisher websites and apps. At LoopMe, we understand the advertising technology ecosystem and its many acronyms may be complex to understand. To help, we have produced a glossary of the common industry terms, which can be found below: Term Definition Ad Exchange A technology platform that facilitates the buying and selling of Ad Inventory between Publishers and Advertisers through real time bidding (or RTB). Ad Inventory Refers to space for advertising that a publisher has available on its websites and/or apps at any given time. Ad Tech A general term that refers to any technology used by the advertising industry that helps to improve media effectiveness and increase operational efficiencies. It can encompass a number of technology platforms, including Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), Data Management Platforms (DMPs), Supply Side Platforms (SSPs) and Ad Exchanges. Ad Network A technology platform that matches a Publisher’s supply of Ad Inventory with Advertisers wishing to display their Advertisements on such Ad Inventory. An Ad Network uses Programmatic Buying to facilitate this. Advertiser A brand, company or individual interested in opportunities to promote their service, product or brand by placing Advertisements on websites and/or apps audiences likely to be interested in their service, product or brand. Advertisement (or Ad) Refers to any form of audio, visual or textual form of information (creative) with the purpose of promoting a service, product or brand of Advertiser. Advertisements are displayed on Publisher websites and/or apps for certain fees and will typically contain links and prompts to redirect the user to the Advertiser’s website upon engaging with it. Agency Also referred to as an advertising agency, ad agency, or a \"creative agency\", is a business dedicated to creating, planning, and handling advertising and sometimes other forms of promotion and marketing for Advertiser clients. Data Management Platform (or DMP) A technology platform used for collecting and managing data. They also allow businesses to identify audience segments (interests of audiences) in turn used to target specific users and contexts with specific Advertisements. Demand Side Platform (or DSP) A technology platform that offers Advertisers (or their Agencies) a centralised interface to manage their buying of Ad Inventory through Open RTB. First Party Data Refers to data about a consumer used by the party who collected it (brand, media company, etc.). IDFA The Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) is a random device identifier assigned by Apple to a user’s device. Advertisers use this to track data so that they can deliver customised advertising. MAID Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) is a user specific, resettable identifier assigned to mobile devices which helps Advertisers delivery customised advertising to a particular user. Open RTB Also referred to as Real-Time Bidding (RTB), is an initiative sponsored by the IAB (the Interactive Advertising Bureau) which provides standards and technical specifications to facilitate the automated trading of digital media between buyers and sellers of Advertising Inventory. Programmatic Buying Is the process of executing transparent planning and buying of Ad Inventory using automation. Agencies use Programmatic Buying on behalf of their Advertiser clients to increase marketing efficiency, helping them to get more out of media budgets. Publisher The owner of a website and/or app with Ad Inventory to sell to Advertisers. Supply Side Platform (or SSP) A technology platform that enables Publishers to offer their Ad Inventory for Ad Exchanges and Demand-Side Platforms to bid on through Open RTB.
