This Privacy Policy provides transparency about our privacy practices, including how we collect, use, and disclose personal information, and how you can exercise your applicable privacy rights. The actual administration of privacy rights may vary based on your individual circumstances and the laws applicable to you, or as AdAdapted may otherwise offer to facilitate in its sole discretion and without obligation. ‍ Scope and Applicability This Privacy Policy applies to our Services, wherever operated, as well as to information collected through our sales and marketing website at www.AdAdapted.com . Our relationship with you determines how this Privacy Policy applies to your information.  For example, as a user of our website, we may collect certain personal information as part of that interaction. In other circumstances, we may process your information as a “Service Provider” or “Third Party” to our Publisher Partners. In such cases, the privacy policy of our Publisher Partners may apply in addition to certain portions of our privacy policy. If you have any question as to who is responsible for your information, please contact us at privacy@AdAdapted.com . ‍ Information We Collect and Receive AdAdapted may collect certain personal information directly or indirectly based on your specific relationship with us. ‍ AdAdapted.com Users : We collect or receive the following categories of personal information (“Business Data”) from your use of our website and your related interactions with us: ‍ Publisher Partner App Users : AdAdapted receives certain personal information (“App Data”) from our Publisher Partners through our SDK installed by our Publisher Partners in their mobile applications: ‍ Our Uses of Personal Information Our use of personal information depends on the type of information and is limited to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (or through other applicable notice) and any other purpose that you may intend or direct through your interactions with us. ‍ Business Data Business Data is used for providing our Services and operating our business, which includes the following purposes: Administering our Service and customer accounts Communicating through email and other means Promoting AdAdapted through sales and marketing Detecting and preventing abuse and security issues Operating and improving our business and services Complying with legal and regulatory obligations ‍ App Data App Data collected through our SDK is used for providing Services to our Publisher Partners and for delivering context-based behavioral advertising, which includes the following purposes: Providing Services to Publisher Partners Troubleshooting technical issues Testing and improving our Services Identifying users of Publisher Partner applications Tracking user interactions Providing context-based and behavioral advertising Retargeting users with advertising on other applications Reporting advertising campaign data to advertisers If we deidentify your personal information or to the extent that it is anonymized either through aggregation or other means, such information is no longer considered “personal information.” We may use such information for any legal purpose without providing you with additional notice. ‍ How We Share Information We share and disclose personal information as described below. ‍ Business Data We share and disclose Business Data as needed to provide our Services and operate our business. However, we do not “sell” Business Data as defined by the CCPA. The categories of parties with whom we share Business Data with include: ‍ App Data In addition to the categories listed above, we share and disclosure App Data as needed to provide our Services to Publisher Partners and advertisers. Our sharing of App Data may constitute a “sale” of personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). ‍ California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) The following provisions apply only to California residents as defined by the CCPA and supplement our broader Privacy Policy: ‍ Business and Service Provider Roles and Relationships Under the CCPA, AdAdapted may be a Business, Service Provider, and/or a Third Party with respect to your personal information, depending on the circumstances. If we are responsible for your personal information as a Business or have otherwise been delegated the responsibility as a Service Provider, we will respond to directly to your privacy requests. If we are processing your information as a Service Provider or have received it as a Third Party, you may choose to exercise your data protection rights directly with the Business, such as our Publisher Partners, e.g. the mobile applications that collected your data. Otherwise, if you wish to make your request to us, we will forward your request to the responsible party. ‍ Do Not Sell My Personal Information In our capacity as a Business and/or Data Broker under the CCPA, AdAdapted sells (and has sold in the preceding 12 months) personal information (e.g. App Data) through our transfer of information to Advertiser Partners and Advertising Networks. In some cases, we combine information with other information as part of such sale. ‍ Privacy Rights of California Residents If you are a California resident, subject to certain limitations, you have the following rights concerning your personal information: Right to Know. You have the right to access the specific pieces of personal information collected about you, the sources from which such information was obtained, the categories of information that have been sold or disclosed for a business purpose, and the commercial purpose for which the information was collected or sold, provided to you in a reasonably portable format if you have a password-protected account. Right to Deletion. You have the right to request that we delete any of the personal information we have collected or maintain about you. Right to Opt-out of Sales of Personal Information.

The CCPA allows for 1 disclosure request per 12-month period at no cost to you. For subsequent requests, we may charge a fee if we determine that the request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded, but will not do so without providing you with a cost estimate before processing your request. If you would like to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, you may opt-out of AdAdapted’s sharing of personal information with third parties by initiating an opt-out request here: Opt-out of AdAdapted .

Accordingly, California residents may exercise their right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information here: Opt-out of AdAdapted . ‍ Data Retention and Disposal We retain and dispose of personal information according to our data retention and disposal policies, which are designed to meet the requirements of applicable law. Generally, this means: Business Data are retained for as long as may be necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained, including any possible follow ups, to the extent that such information is not subject to a lawful request for deletion. We may also retain Business Data for a reasonable time after its collection to ensure the integrity of log files, prevent fraud and spoofing, and protect the security of our Services.
