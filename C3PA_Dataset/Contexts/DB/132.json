Like many online services, we and our third-party partners and providers may use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or interact with our email communications and Services. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.  Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using our online Services, as some features and services on our online Services may not work properly.  Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.  In addition, if you want to reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use.  You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it. - Web Beacons (tracking pixels). Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels) are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or open an email and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons used on web pages or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. We also use web beacons to learn if you have clicked on any links contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you. ‍ - Information from third parties. We may collect your Personal Information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. For example, you have the option of registering and signing into Warmly with a third- party authentication provider.

Social Media Widgets and Advertising .  The Services may include social media features, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube or other widgets.  These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to the Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies.  Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Twitter, LinkedIn,  and other social media forums.  These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in the Services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.  We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed email address, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform.  These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.  If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.  You may learn more about advertising preferences by clicking on the links provided below.  Please note that these links are provided for your convenience only and we do not control the content or features that may be available on these third-party services.We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics.  These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services.  You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at https://google.com/ads/preferences , or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices .  For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google’s site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ .  You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ .

Protection of Information Warmly considers the security of all the information and data within our control to be a top priority, and consistent with this we implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, such information or data. However, no security system is impenetrable, and unanticipated system failures or the efforts of malicious actors are an unfortunate reality on the internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the information and data within our control, including Personal Information, is absolutely secure. Our Policy Towards Children Warmly does not direct our services towards individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from individuals under the age of 18, we will take reasonable measures to delete such information from our records and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required by law). If you become aware that Warmly has improperly collected information from individuals under the age of 18, please contact us immediately at privacy@warmly.ai . Additional Notice to Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland Legal Bases for Collection and Processing of Information as ControllerOur collection and processing of your Personal Information is supported by a number of legal bases.

Please note that while we may rely on one legal basis for a particular activity, if that is no longer applicable or available then we may be able to rely on another basis. With Your Consent. We collect and process some of your Personal Information because we obtain your consent. When we want to use cookies to collect Personal Information from you for performance or marketing reasons, for example, we obtain your consent by displaying a banner when you first visit our Site (or, if you have deleted your cookies, when you next visit) that discloses the reasons we use cookies to collect information and links to this Privacy Policy which in turn contains more detailed information about our collection, third-party collection, and opt-out information. You must accept the use of those cookies or you may not visit or use our Site. To Fulfill a Contract. We collect and process some of your Personal Information because we need to do so either to enter into or fulfill a contract we have with you. For example, we process your Personal Information when we provide Services to you that you have purchased on our Site. For a Legitimate Interest. We may process your Personal Information where we or a third party have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how people are using our Services, both to improve them and to market them more effectively. Therefore, we may use your Personal Information to understand and analyze your use of our Services. When we rely on our legitimate interest, we will carry out a balancing test between our legitimate interests and your privacy rights. Our legitimate interests include: understanding how our audience interacts with our content, our marketing and promotions, and our Services; learning about our audience in order to improve our Services for them; developing, delivering, and maintaining relevant and engaging content and promotional information; supporting the dissemination of information on topics of interest to individuals and the community; supporting individuals’ rights to receive information; and conducting our business activities and achieving our business goals. To Comply with Legal Obligations. We will process your Personal Information when necessary to comply with legal and regulatory obligations or defend claims. For example, we may share your Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, or law enforcement agency's request.Retention of InformationWe will only keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process it (and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means), and the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer Personal Information. Upon expiration of the applicable retention period we will securely destroy your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Access, Correction and Deletion of Information We Collect For Personal Information that we hold about you, you may have the right (subject to exceptions allowed by law) to: - request access to your Personal Information; - request we correct any inaccurate Personal Information; - request we delete any Personal Information; - restrict the processing of Personal Information; - object to the processing of Personal Information; and/or - receive a copy of your Personal Information in a structured and commonly used machine-readable format or have such Personal Information transmitted to another company.

If you have an account for our Service, you have the ability to modify certain information in your profile/virtual business card (e.g., your contact information) through the account setting page or a similar option provided on the Service.

Transfer of Information We are located in the United States and your Personal Information that we collect is processed and stored in the United States. We rely on derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and on contractual clauses in our agreements. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information with your consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of ours in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Given the lack of a finding of “adequacy”, there may be a risk that the supervisory authority and/or data processing principles and/or data subject rights in the United States might not be sufficiently appropriate or comprehensive safeguards from the perspective of the EU. We strive, however, to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and only to use it consistent with your relationship with us and the practices described in this Privacy Notice. Our vendors and others with whom we share your Personal Information in accordance with this Policy are either certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks or we use contractual clauses in our agreements with them that are designed to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
