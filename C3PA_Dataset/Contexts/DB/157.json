That information may also be combined and shared with other information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) with third party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use information (and similar information collected from other websites and Properties) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to individuals within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.
