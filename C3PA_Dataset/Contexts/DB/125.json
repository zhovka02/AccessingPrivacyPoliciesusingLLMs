We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity prior to removal.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. There is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com . Please be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly. C.

Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at google.com/settings/ads.com . Companies and vendors that provide targeted ads to you are required to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ DAA ”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“ NAI ”). To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices ; and (ii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ . Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services). Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.
