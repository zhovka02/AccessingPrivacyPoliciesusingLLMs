Any revision\n    and/or addition to this Privacy Policy shall become effective and binding on you when you continue to use the\n    Website on or after the effective date of such revision and/or addition. 1.

We may automatically and\n    through third-party tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics) gather certain non-personal information about your\n    use of the Website and store it in log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, Internet\n    Service Provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. For non-member\n    visitors, we remove all identifying information and the aggregated tracking information solely to improve the\n    quality of our products and services. Out of respect for your privacy, we do not link this automatically collected\n    data to your personal information. We may also collect deidentified, anonymous and aggregate information such as\n    age, gender, race, religion, household income for analytical purposes. This information may be collected via several technologies, including cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs and other\n    means. All of this information belongs to us, and we use it to improve effectiveness, content, layout and/or\n    operation of our website. You can remove certain cookies by following the directions in your Internet browser’s\n    “help” file or through our Cookie Preferences (see Section __ below). If you disable cookies, your ability to use\n    areas of the Sites may be limited. 1.3 Location Information. At this time, we do not collect location information\n    from mobile devices. 2. Information Use We do not sell any personal information. 2.1 How We Use Automatically Collected Information. The information we collect\n    automatically is statistical data and generally does not contain personal information. However, we may maintain it\n    or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. We will use this\n    automatically-collected information to improve the Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service,\n    including to: Estimate our audience size and usage patterns; Improve the design and content of our website; Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize the Website according to your individual\n        interests; Speed up your searches; and Recognize you when you return to the Website. 3. Usage of Cookies and Other Network Technologies 3.1 Cookies. The Website uses “cookies” and other web tracking tools to enhance\n    your online experience with us. We may store information about you using the cookies on our website. A cookie (also\n    called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website\n    and stored on the user’s computer by the user’s web browser while the user is browsing. We use cookies to improve\n    your site experience, to assess content usage, to distinguish you from other users of our site and to support the\n    marketing of our services. For example, cookies help determine what kind of content we will serve to the user – a\n    use case might be, if a user is browsing a particular set of page content themes, we might serve that theme in the\n    form of advertising as we’ve identified them as an interested party of that theme. We want to be completely transparent about the cookies we use and to make their control as easy as possible for you.\n    When you first enter the Website, you will be asked to accept or reject cookies via the Cookie Notice. You are free\n    to decline to accept cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our offerings.\n    Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you\n    direct your browser to our Website. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may still browse our Website. Certain\n    of the cookies are necessary in order for the site to function. In certain circumstances, we may link the\n    information we store in cookies to personal information you submit while using the Website. Further, if you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the file management\n    software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies under the following file names. Other information on\n    deleting or controlling cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org .\n    Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or\n    features of our website. 3.2 GIFs. We or our service providers may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,”\n    “clear GIFs,” “embedded links” and other commonly-used information-gathering tools in connection with some website\n    pages and HTML-formatted email messages. We use these tools for such purposes as compiling aggregate statistics\n    about website usage and response rates. A pixel tag is an electronic image (often a single pixel), that is\n    ordinarily not visible to website visitors, and may be associated with cookies on visitors’ hard drives. Pixel tags\n    allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver\n    customized services, and to help determine the effectiveness of the Website and services. When used in\n    HTML-formatted email messages, pixel tags can inform the sender of the email whether and when the email has been\n    opened. 3.3 Clickstreams. As you use the Internet, you leave a trail of electronic\n    information at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as \"clickstream data”, can\n    be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can reveal the type of computer and browsing\n    software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the website. We may use clickstream data as\n    a form of non-personal information to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Website, how\n    visitors navigate through the Website, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. We\n    will only use this information to improve the Website. 3.4 Advertising. Note that we may use cookies and other technologies for\n    purposes of on-line advertising. This means that when you use the services, we or third-party ad servers, ad network\n    providers or advertisers (collectively “Ad Providers”) may use cookies that they collect or that we provide to them.\n    Such Ad Providers may collect information about your use of the services (including mobile applications) or your\n    online activities over time and across different websites and devices. Collected information may include the content\n    you viewed, the date and time that you viewed this content, and the website that referred you to the services. This\n    information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address. Ad Providers may provide\n    you with advertisements that you may see on the services or on affiliated websites. To improve the relevancy and\n    help measure the effectiveness of such advertisements, the Ad Providers may use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs or\n    similar technologies. These practices help tailor advertisements that are relevant and of use to you. You may\n    control or opt-out of such advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser as described above. 3.5 User Behavior Tracking. We may track the webpages and links our users visit\n    within the Website, in order to determine what services are most popular. We may use such tracking data to deliver\n    customized content and advertising to users whose behavior indicates they are interested in a particular subject\n    area. We may also collect user data to track the areas of a webpage where users most frequently move the mouse or\n    click. These tracking activities make it possible to monitor and analyze web traffic and evaluate user behavior to\n    customize our services. 4. Do Not Track Notice Many modern web browsers give you the option to send a “Do Not Track” signal to the websites you visit, indicating\n    that you do not wish to be tracked. At this time, the Website and services do not specifically respond to “Do Not\n    Track” signals. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our third-party advertisers and analytics service providers to\n    learn about your choices about information they collect from you. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative\n    offers information about some of the Internet advertising companies we may use, including how to opt-out of\n    interest-based advertising they deliver. For all the details, including how to turn on Do Not Track, visit www.donottrack.us . 5. Disclosure and Sharing We may share anonymous, deidentified aggregate information with third parties, including affiliated and\n    non-affiliated organizations such as advertisers. 6. California Residents The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other California privacy laws provides California residents\n    (i.e., consumers) with specific rights regarding personal information. This Privacy Notice describes those CCPA\n    rights and how to exercise those rights. 6.1 The Information We Collect and How We Use Your Information Categories of Personal Information We Collect From You Use of Personal Information De-identified Website usage data (e.g., features/pages accessed by a member) To operate and improve the Website and associated services.

We may do this for\n    the convenience of you and other users of the Website, but we do not have control over the operation of these\n    third-party websites.
