California Resident Additional Rights If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information; subject to exclusions from the rights granted under California law with respect to certain information governed by certain sector-specific privacy laws.

The right to request that we disclose certain personal information to you about our collection, use, disclosure and sale of your personal information over the prior 12 month period. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will disclose to you: the categories of personal information collected, the sources collected from, the purpose for collection, the categories of third parties shared with, and the specific pieces of personal information collected about you. Deletion Request Rights . The right to request we delete any of your personal information we’ve collected from you and retained (subject to exceptions granted under law). Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete your personal information records, unless an exception applies. Only a California resident, or someone legally authorized to act on such California resident’s behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to his or her personal information. In connection with submitting a request, we may require you to provide the following information: name, email, phone number and address. In general, we have the right to require you to provide written permission granting authority to your representative and for your agent to verify its identity directly with us, and we may deny a request from your representative who does not submit proof of authorization as we request. A California resident may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify the requestor is the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to a request or provide personal information if we cannot verify the identity or authority to make the request. We will endeavor to confirm receipt of a request within 10 days following submission and provide information about how we will process the request. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional 45 days), we will provide notice in writing explaining the reason for the extended time period. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require a California resident to create an account with us. We may deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request receipt date. If we deny a request, we will provide a response explaining the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We may sell personal information of a California resident, subject to such California resident’s right to opt out of those sales.
