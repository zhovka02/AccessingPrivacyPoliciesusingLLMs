All references in this Policy to the Site include future samples and savings themed Sites that we and our Affiliates (defined below) may create, own and/or operate. This Policy describes the types of information that we gather from you and the other people who visit the Site (“Users”), how we may use that information and how you can contact us regarding this Policy and your personal information. This Policy also describes additional rights that California Users have under the California “Shine the Light” law and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). 1: Your Consent Please read this entire Policy carefully before using the Site or providing us with any information that  identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular User (“Personal Information” or “PI”) and information that is not personally identifiable to a User (“non-PI)” (together, “Information”). When you access or use the Site, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of your Information in accordance with this Policy by us, our third party marketing partners, and our parent, subsidiaries and entities under common control with us (“Affiliates”). If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site. 2: California “Shine the Light” Law The California “Shine the Light” law permits Users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please send an email request to privacy@360mediadirect.com and identify that it is a “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line of the email, or by sending a letter with the request to: 360 Media Direct Attention: Privacy Request 653 W Fallbrook Ave Ste 101 Fresno, CA 93711 Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting. In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the User’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising. If your browser is set to do not track, our Site will respond in accordance with that setting so that, for example, we will not be able to access any cookies stored in your browser. The impact a do not track setting has on a website’s operation varies from browser to browser. You should be aware that we use other means to identify Users who have previously visited our Site, including their email address and tracking a User’s online behavior while on our Site. We may use this information to tailor the User’s experience should they visit our Site or sites belonging to our Affiliates in the future. Setting your browser to “do not track” will have no impact on these practices. 3: Categories and Sources of Information Collected We and our marketing partners and Affiliates have collected the following categories of Personal Information (“PI”) from Users in the last 12 months: (1) Identifiers, including your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, age, gender and (2) Internet Related Information, including the type of device you use, the type of browser you use, your browsing history on our Sites or sites belonging to our Affiliates, and your IP address. We collect this Information in a number of different ways. We collect Information submitted by a User on our Site, and we also use technological means to collect Information about a User. This Information may be supplemented or verified by third-party services. We may also collect non-PI that a User submits as part of our surveys, such as political party registration, shoe size, laundry preferences, household income, pet ownership, etc. could be associated with your PI. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or an ad from another website or from an email sent from one of our marketing partners, then we may also capture that information to understand the interests of our Users and to keep track of third parties who direct Users to our Sites. Users may supply information through our dynamically determined survey questions, which we then associate with the User’s PI to help us identify the products and services they may be interested in. We track and record a User’s behavior while on our Site and associate it with the User’s PI so that if a User returns to our Site, we can, for example, avoid showing the User the same offers or asking the same survey questions. In order for a User to take full advantage of the Site, we ask Users to voluntarily provide their PI to us. If a User chooses not to provide us with their PI by simply not entering it on the Site or not otherwise providing it to us, the User will not be able to access or use certain of the services or features available through the Site that require the submission of that PI. For example, a User that chose to provide us with the PI required to register, but chose not to provide us with PII in response to a particular survey question would not receive the available points for that survey. We use technologies such as “cookies” (small text files placed/dropped on a User’s device), “web beacons” (single-pixel GIF files) or similar technologies to track the User’s online behavior and interaction with the Site, including Google Analytics-related cookies, PushPros -related cookies, and AdRoll-related cookies.

An authorized agent may make a request on your behalf by contacting us at privacy@360mediadirect.com with the subject “proxy request” together with detailed information about you. Please note that we will take steps to verify any such request with you, and may deny the request if it cannot be verified.

The verifiable User request must: Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are: (1) the California resident about whom we collected personal information; or (2) an authorized representative.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable User request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. F.

We collect this Information in a number of different ways. We collect Information submitted by a User on our Site, and we also use technological means to collect Information about a User. This Information may be supplemented or verified by third-party services.\\n\\nWe may also collect non-PI that a User submits as part of our surveys, such as political party registration, shoe size, laundry preferences, household income, pet ownership, etc. could be associated with your PI.\\n\\nIf you reached the Site by clicking on a link or an ad from another website or from an email sent from one of our marketing partners, then we may also capture that information to understand the interests of our Users and to keep track of third parties who direct Users to our Sites. Users may supply information through our dynamically determined survey questions, which we then associate with the User’s PI to help us identify the products and services they may be interested in. We track and record a User’s behavior while on our Site and associate it with the User’s PI so that if a User returns to our Site, we can, for example, avoid showing the User the same offers or asking the same survey questions.\\n\\nIn order for a User to take full advantage of the Site, we ask Users to voluntarily provide their PI to us. If a User chooses not to provide us with their PI by simply not entering it on the Site or not otherwise providing it to us, the User will not be able to access or use certain of the services or features available through the Site that require the submission of that PI. For example, a User that chose to provide us with the PI required to register, but chose not to provide us with PII in response to a particular survey question would not receive the available points for that survey.\\n\\nWe use technologies such as “cookies” (small text files placed/dropped on a User’s device), “web beacons” (single-pixel GIF files) or similar technologies to track the User’s online behavior and interaction with the Site, including Google Analytics-related cookies, PushPros -related cookies, and AdRoll-related cookies.
