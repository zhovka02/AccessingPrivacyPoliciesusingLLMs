You have a right to be provided with a notice at minimum of the categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which it is used at or before the points of collection.

Submitting Requests Requests to exercise your rights may be submitted by emailing us at support@streamable.com . Please be prepared to provide your first and last name and email address that matches information we currently have on file.
