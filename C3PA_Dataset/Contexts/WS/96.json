In such cases, we process personal information under the direction of that Marketplace Client as a service provider, and we have no direct relationship with the individuals (consumers) whose personal information we process. Where ZipRecruiter acts as a service provider, it will be subject to a separate Master Services Agreement, Insertion Order, and/or Services Agreement, as applicable, executed by the Marketplace Client, which expressly incorporates the Marketplace Services Privacy and Security Addendum (“Privacy Addendum”). The Privacy Addendum requires ZipRecruiter to collect, retain, use, disclose, and/or otherwise process personal information solely as a service provider. Where ZipRecruiter collects your personal information in the capacity of a service provider, and you want to know/access, correct, amend, or delete your personal information, or have another request, we will provide you with the Client’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however, circumstances may necessitate ZipRecruiter assisting you with your question or request. 8. Retention of Personal Information Different retention periods apply for different types and categories of personal information. Table 5 below identifies the criteria used to determine the length of time ZipRecruiter intends to retain each category of personal information. Once you request that we delete your personal information, we will do so except where we are otherwise permitted or required to retain that information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Table 5 - Retention Criteria Categories of Personal Information Criteria Used to Determine the Applicable Retention Period Identifiers (e.g., name, alias, postal address, email address, telephone number, social media profile, social media address, username, unique personal identifier, online identifier, IP address, device IDs, account name, other similar identifiers, and SSN) To comply with our legal obligations under applicable law; to provide our Services to you or the time period that a User decides to keep their account open; the time that ZipRecruiter uses the data in furtherance of fraud prevention, security, or to otherwise help ensure the integrity of the Services; the time that ZipRecruiter uses the data in furtherance of establishing or defending a legal, regulatory, or law enforcement claim or investigation; and/or for any other permitted purpose under the CCPA. If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.
