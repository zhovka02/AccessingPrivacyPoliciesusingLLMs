Sub Total: Discount Amount: Tax: Estimated Subtotal Continue Shopping Checkout Privacy Notice Effective Date: August 1, 2023 Darden Global Privacy Statement Darden is based in the U.S., and its collection and use of Personal Information is processed subject to U.S. Data Protection laws. Personal Information is information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you. For example, when you place an order online, to fulfill your order, we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information. Some laws define “personal information” differently, and we use those definitions when they are applicable. Darden does not store data collected through our websites or mobile apps in any location outside of the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union (“EU”) or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, by providing your Personal Information on our websites or mobile apps, you are acknowledging that such collection may occur and expressly grant permission to do so. Darden will take appropriate steps to ensure that your Personal Information is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Policy (the “Notice”). Please note that this Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, Domestic or International. For more information on Franchised Operators and Licensees, please visit https://franchisedarden.com for more information. Your Privacy Our Notice describes the information we collect from and about you during your visit to our online interfaces (including websites, mobile applications, social media, or other digital channels), via your in-restaurant interactions, and through your interaction with in-restaurant devices owned or controlled by us (collectively, the “Sites”). It also describes how we use information about you and with whom we disclose it. This Notice applies only to those Darden interfaces that link directly to this Notice. The terms \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" in this Notice refer to Darden and its family of companies. It's important to know that our websites or mobile apps may contain links to third-party sites not controlled by Darden or covered by this Notice. We recommend that you check the privacy statements of other sites you visit before providing any Personal Information.

Mobile Information: When you use or access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect information such as your unique device ID and your location.

Geolocation information: We may collect or infer information about your general or precise location when you access or use the Services, visit our restaurants or support center, or turn on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other geolocation functionality on your device. Device-Based Advertising: We may also use device information, particularly in mobile advertising, to help deliver our ads and measure ad campaign effectiveness. Darden and the companies we work with may collect some certain information when you visit one of our sites or see our ads. Compiling and comparing this information creates a unique ID for individual devices and can be \"matched\" to the same information on other sites or mobile applications. Some companies we work with are also able to associate related devices into households based on common characteristics, such as IP addresses.

Pixels/Beacons: We or third-party ad servers, including Facebook, may use cookies or invisible pixels or beacons on our websites or mobile apps to count how many users visit certain pages or take certain actions to collect or receive information from our websites, mobile apps and elsewhere on the Internet.
