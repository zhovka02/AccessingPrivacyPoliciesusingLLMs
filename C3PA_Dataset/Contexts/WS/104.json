Automated Decision Making If You complete the “seller settings” within Your account, indicating a desire to sell through Our Service, You will undergo an automated assessment of Your email address to verify its validity.

In addition, as part of Our seller verification process, We may conduct facial cross-checks of identity cards, and photos or video selfies, uploaded by You to our identity verification provider’s platform. This process is completed solely through automated means and results in profiling. Both of these assessments could impact You financially if You are not eligible to sell through Our Service as a result.
