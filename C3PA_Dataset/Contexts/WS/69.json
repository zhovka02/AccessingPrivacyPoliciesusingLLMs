We may associate personal information about you with interest segments or profiles as part of the provision\nof Oracle Advertising services to our customers and partners: Interest Segments are a specific group of consumers that share a common behavior or\npreference used for direct marketing by our customers. For example: in market for travel specials to\nHawaii. Profiles are a set of attributes about a specific consumer or device, or a set of\nmultiple consumers or devices sharing common attributes used for marketing by our customers. For\nexample: age bracket 25-55; adventurous traveler; surfing enthusiast; in market for travel specials to\nHawaii. 5. FOR WHAT COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS PURPOSE DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? We use personal information for the following commercial purposes: a) to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to market products and services to you based on your interests; b) to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and\nservices; We use personal information for the following business purposes: c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems; d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business. These purposes are described below in further detail. a) For personal information collected from individuals located outside the EU/EEA/UK and Switzerland only: to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to market products and services to you based on your interests We process personal information about you for marketing purposes to provide Advertising services to Oracle customers and partners designed to enable them to advertise products and services to you via online and offline marketing activities based on your interests. “Marketing purposes” means the processing of offline and online personal information, as\ndefined in Section 4: (i) to solicit or induce a purchase, rental, lease, or exchange of products or\nservices directly to consumers or businesses via offline and online advertising campaigns; (ii) to develop\nmarket research or market surveys or to provide verification services to marketers; (iii) to create,\ncommunicate, deliver, and exchange offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society\nat large; or (iv) to encourage safe practices and trends and the provision of factual information,\nincluding, by way of example, providing product or automotive recall notices. More specifically, Oracle can process information about you: i. For online interest-based advertising delivered through Oracle Advertising partners that display\nonline advertising to you on behalf of Oracle Advertising customers. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to market the company’s travel\nspecials to Hawaii to a specific group of individuals (also known as an audience ) that\nmay be interested in those specials. The marketing professional uses Oracle Advertising services to\ncreate an audience interested in travel to Hawaii. If you have visited a travel website previously and\nhave expressed an interest in Hawaiian vacations, you may be placed in the travel company’s audience and\nsubsequently see advertisements for a vacation to Hawaii on other websites (because a cookie has been\nplaced on your browser) or, in the United States, via a connected device (due to an association between\nyour IP address and device identifier). ii. For offline and online campaign measurement, analytics, and development of insights on behalf of our\nOracle Advertising customers. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to better understand if the\ncompany’s marketing campaign for travel specials to Hawaii contributed to an increase in their product\nsales. The marketing professional uses Oracle Advertising services to see how many display or videos ads\nwere viewed, and whether the ads were clicked on and a purchase was made. iii. For enabling our Oracle Advertising customers to personalize their products and services, including\nsite optimization, email personalization, and dynamic marketing and advertising optimization. Example: if you have previously indicated an interest in travel to Hawaii, when you visit a travel\ncompany’s website it can display tailored offers for Hawaiian vacations on their homepage. iv. For linking Profiles and Interest Segments to enable Oracle Advertising customers and partners to\nconnect your Interest Segments across the various browsers and/or devices you may use for the purposes\ndescribed in this section. Example: you are interested in vacations offered by a travel company and have clicked on their online\nadvertising. You are logged into several devices (your desktop, smartphone, and tablet) using the same\nlogin. Oracle Advertising partners have indicated that you are likely the same user across those same\ndevices. The travel company is able to display vacation offers to you (via a de-identified cookie ID) on\nthese different devices. v. For creating modelled online and offline “lookalike” audiences for Oracle Advertising customers’\nproducts and services. Example: a marketing professional working for a travel company wants to find new potential customers who\nare, like you, likely to be interested in travel to Hawaii. Oracle Advertising services can help the\ntravel company by looking for key characteristics between Profiles that have expressed an interest in\ntraveling to Hawaii and other Profiles where a similar interest can be inferred based on these\ncharacteristics, such as an interest in travel to tropical islands. vi. For enabling our Oracle Advertising customers to associate first-party information to certain Oracle\nAdvertising identifiers in order to deliver marketing and advertising services to you. Example: A travel company has its own lists of customers who have purchased travel arrangements with\nthem, with names, emails, and addresses. The travel company wants to be able to reach out to these\ncustomers with online advertising. The Oracle Advertising services can help the travel company by\nconverting the company’s own customer lists from identified names, emails, and addresses, to\nde-identified groups of cookie and device IDs provided by Oracle Advertising, in a process known in the\nadvertising industry as “onboarding”. vii. For individuals located in the United States only: to allow our customers to deliver catalogues to your physical address that may be of interest to you based on your previous offline purchase behavior. b) For personal information collected from individuals located outside the EU/EEA/UK and Switzerland only: to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of Oracle products and services We may process personal information for Oracle’s own research and development purposes. For example: to enhance data quality, develop new features and functionality, and for statistical\nanalyses related to the performance and operation of Oracle Advertising services. c) to manage the security of our sites, networks and systems We can collect usage and systems operations data from Oracle Advertising services for security and\noperations management to help keep Oracle, customer, and partner networks and systems, as well as our\nproducts and services, secure. We may also collect usage and systems operations data to investigate and\nprevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, including ad fraud and to detect\nbots. d) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business In some cases, we may process personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For\nexample, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process\npersonal information in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and\ninvestigations, for finance and accounting, archiving, and insurance purposes. 6. CATEGORIES OF SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION Oracle may process both offline and online information about you, including information from publicly\navailable sources or third-party data providers.

Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixel tags and device identifiers) are used by Oracle and our\nadvertising technology partners to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different\nservices and devices for the purposes specified in Section 5 above. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a\nbrowser on a connected device. We or our Oracle Advertising partners may use cookies to, among other things,\ntrack user trends and collect information about how you use our customers’ sites or interact with\nadvertising. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be able\nto change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a\nthird-party cookie is being sent. Check your browser’s “help” files to learn more about\nhandling cookies. Pixel Tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1 pixels that are\nplaced on webpages that use this technology for marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these\nwebpages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be used with cookies or alone.\nWhen used with cookies, pixel tags can track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant\nonline advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out of cookies, pixel tags simply detect\na unique website visit and how you interacted with the advertising, but do not track an individual to\nprovide relevant online advertising. You can opt out of cookies using the opt-out tools in the next section. 13. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? Pursuant to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),\nand other applicable laws and regulations, individuals in certain jurisdictions may have data subject rights\nenabling them to request to opt-out of third-party sharing or selling, delete or correct, or request to\naccess and receive a copy of their personal information in Oracle’s possession or for which Oracle is\notherwise responsible. Opt-out and object to our use of information about you Oracle offers multiple ways for you to opt out of third party sharing or selling and object to our use of\ninformation about you: Oracle Advertising Opt-out. Access the Oracle Advertising opt-out\ntool . Please note that if you use this opt-out tool, Oracle will opt you out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Advertising services involving both first-party use of your information as well as any third-party sharing or selling of your information. Customers remain responsible for their own first-party data collection and processing practices. See Section 2 above for\nmore information on the distinction between first-party and third-party information. The Oracle Advertising opt-out will prevent Oracle from delivering third-party audiences to connected\ndevices such as smart televisions or streaming devices; however, you can also visit your device’s\nsettings menu or privacy policy for information on how to opt-out directly with your connected devices. AdTech Industry Opt-Out. You may also opt-out of third-party sharing or selling by Oracle Advertising services by using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups. These industry groups provide detailed information on how to opt-out of tailored advertising on a browser or via device settings: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA): http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ Network Advertising Initiative (NAI): http://optout.networkadvertising.org European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (EDAA): http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and http://www.edaa.eu/ Device Opt-Out. While the opt-out methods described above often also work for mobile web browsing, mobile ‘app’ or other internet connected TV device environments may not accept cookies. You may want to consider installing the AppChoices App provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) to exercise opt-out control for specific companies, including Oracle, when in a mobile app environment. See more information on how to download and configure the AppChoices App relevant for your mobile platform. You can also visit the NAI’s website for more information and instructions on opting out on mobile devices and internet connected TV devices. Audience Matched Advertising Opt-Out. Oracle Advertising provides “Audience Matched Advertising” where Oracle Advertising uses hashed emails to create tailored digital advertising to provide Oracle Advertising online services. The NAI provides an email-based opt-out to opt-out of this activity. Please visit the NAI’s website for more information and instructions on opting out of Audience Matched Advertising. Do Not Track. Oracle honors “Do Not Track” browser settings, meaning we\nwill not track your browser for marketing purposes while you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your\nbrowser settings. Please note that if you opt-out using any of the first three opt-out tools, you may still temporarily see\ninterest-based advertising from Oracle Advertising customers due to advertising campaigns from those\ncustomers already underway. However, you will be opted-out of all future advertising campaigns from\ncustomers that use Oracle Advertising services. Also note that the first three opt-out tools are currently cookie-based and prevent Oracle from using,\nsharing, or selling your personal information for interest-based advertising on the browser on which they\nare installed. As a result, these opt out tools will only function if your browser is set to accept\nthird-party cookies and may not function where cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed\n(e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your browser settings,\nswitch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt out again. Oracle does\nnot use persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile or deleted cookie. If you want to opt-out of Oracle’s use of information about you for Oracle Advertising services, and do not\nwant to receive third-party cookies, you can also change your browser settings on your computer or other\ndevice you are using to connect to the internet. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you\nopt-out of all advertising cookies, including Oracle cookies. Delete or correct information about you Unless retained solely for legal and compliance purposes, Oracle will delete or correct your online or\noffline personal information, upon request, as set forth below: You can erase or delete all online information about you by opting out of Oracle Advertising\nservices using the Oracle Advertising\nopt-out tool above. If you would like to submit a request to have offline information about you, if any, erased\nor deleted, you can use this form . Given the nature and purpose of the processing activities, in the event your personal information contains\nany inaccuracies, Oracle will delete your personal information per the process set above for deletion. Access information about you In order to exercise your right to access your online information processed by Oracle\nAdvertising, you can use the Oracle\nAdvertising Registry (‘Registry’) to view the online segments Oracle has associated with your\ndevice. By accessing this Registry, you can view the types of third-party interest segments that are shared\nwith or sold to Oracle Advertising customers. Please note that the interest segments you see within the\nRegistry is information from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer, or device that you\nare using to visit the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry from a different\nbrowser, computer, or device. For a complete picture of the segments associated with all of your browsers\nand devices, we therefore recommend using these different browsers and devices when accessing the Registry. To request access to your offline information, please visit the Oracle Advertising access\nsite, available at https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/request-your-data .\nWhile the majority of offline access requests can be handled quickly, complex requests may take more\nresearch and time. In such cases, you will be contacted regarding the nature of the request and appropriate\nnext steps within 45 days from the date of receipt of your request. Upon visiting the Oracle Advertising\naccess site, you will be asked to verify your identity to submit your request. If you cannot verify your\nrequest via the online portal, you can submit a written request via postal mail to the Oracle Global Data\nProtection Officer at the address below with a copy of a government-issued ID or other proof of identity for\nverification purposes. We cannot provide access to offline data unless Oracle can verify the identity of the\nindividual making the request. Oracle Advertising only processes offline personal information on residents\nwithin the United States. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law unless such data is only retained for legal\nand compliance purposes. Oracle will not discriminate against consumers who have exercised the deletion,\nopt-out, or access rights provided to them in this Privacy Policy. We cannot provide first-party information that is collected and maintained by our customers. If you have\nquestions in regards to first-party information, Oracle recommends that you contact directly the company\nthat collected it from you. Deceased Do Not Contact Registration with the DMA. We recognize that receiving mail for a\ndeceased loved one can be difficult for family members, friends, or caretakers. You can opt-out your loved\none using the Oracle Advertising opt-out tool; however, Oracle’s opt-out tool is limited to only Oracle’s\nuse and sharing of your loved one’s personal information. We recommend using the DMA Deceased Do Not Contact\nRegistration to remove the names of your deceased loved ones from commercial marketing lists for all\ncompanies that ingest this list, available here: https://www.ims-dm.com/cgi/ddnc.php . 14. DOES ORACLE ADVERTISING COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION? Oracle does not create any online interest segments that reflect personal information that is sensitive, as\ndefined by law and self-regulatory frameworks, or personal information that Oracle has deemed “sensitive.”\nWe also have operational procedures in our platform designed to prevent our partners and customers from\nusing personal information provided to them by Oracle to create interest segments that we consider\nsensitive.
