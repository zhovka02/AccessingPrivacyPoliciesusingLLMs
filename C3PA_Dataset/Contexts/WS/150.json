last twelve months, we have disclosed each of the categories of personal information listed above for business purposes, as set out above.

We may disclose the following categories of personal information about FORTUNE conference registrants with FORTUNE conference sponsors in a way that may be considered a sale: If you are a subscriber, we may disclose the following categories of information about your subscription with companies that want to market to you in a way that may be considered a sale: Sharing Personal Information for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising We may share the following categories personal information with third-party cookie, ad-tech providers and others throughout the online advertising ecosystem for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising: We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

Notice of Financial Incentives From time to time, we may run certain offers and promotions that may be deemed “financial incentives” in relation to our collection of personal information under the CCPA.

You can make a request to delete your data in order to withdraw from such a program by following the instructions under the “How to Exercise Your California Privacy Rights” section of this California Privacy Notice. The value of such a program to FORTUNE is related to the value of your information to us and the costs associated with offering the program.
