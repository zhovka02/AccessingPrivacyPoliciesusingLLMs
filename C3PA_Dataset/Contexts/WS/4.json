This policy explains how\n                    we use\n                    your information and how we keep it safe. Importantly, it explains the choices you can make at any time about how your information is\n                    used. When this Policy applies This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers the information generated when you use or subscribe to AT&T products, services, apps, websites or networks to which this Policy is linked. In the Policy, we call them “Products or Services” for short. They include voice, data, internet and other products, services and apps. This Policy applies to you and anyone who uses our Products or Services under your account, except where we identify that separate AT&T privacy policies or terms and conditions apply. You are responsible for making sure all users under your account understand and agree to this Policy. Here are special circumstances where this Policy may not apply, or may apply in addition to other policies: Some of our Products or Services – for example our FirstNet service – may be covered by their own privacy policies or additional privacy terms and conditions, while, U-verse TV is governed by the DIRECTV privacy policy. Some of our affiliates – such as DIRECTV and Cricket – have their own privacy policies that apply to data they collect from products, services and apps they provide. Any data collected subject to this Policy that is shared with those affiliates will still be treated consistent with this Policy. Some areas both inside and outside of the United States – for example California and the European Union – require us to adopt different policy terms and commitments in accordance with local laws. In certain cases, when you’re using your AT&T Products or Services, other companies may be collecting information, so that your information may be covered by this Policy and other privacy policies at the same time. Here are some examples: if you purchase one of our Products or Services from a retailer; if you use our Services to connect to a social networking service or another company’s Wi-Fi network; or if you provide your information to another company through a co-branded website, app or service controlled by the other company. In those cases, any information you provide to those companies may be subject to just their policy, or subject to both their policy and ours. If you are an AT&T business customer, we may have written Product or Service agreements that contain specific provisions about confidentiality, security or handling of information. When one of those agreements differs from or conflicts with this Policy, the terms of those agreements will apply instead. Close The information we collect We collect information about you and how you’re using our Products or Services along with information about your devices and equipment. This may include performance information, along with web browsing, location and video viewing information.

For security purposes, including preventing and investigating illegal activities and violations of our Terms, Use Policies and other service conditions or restrictions. Close How we share your information We share it with your permission. We share it across AT&T companies. We share it with non-AT&T companies or entities as explained in this Policy. For more details about how your information may be shared for advertising and marketing see Privacy Choices and Controls . Sharing information across the AT&T affiliates Like many large companies, AT&T is made up of many affiliates. Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among AT&T affiliates Button Icon , such as DIRECTV and Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your State Data Rights and Choices . We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set. Sharing information with non-AT&T companies that provide services for us or for you We share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. Sharing information with non-AT&T companies to enable Identity Verification We may share information with non-AT&T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-AT&T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing. If you’re an AT&T Prepaid customer, text “STOP” to 8010 to stop sharing with Identity Verification or “RESUME” to restart sharing at any time. Other customers can opt out of Identity Verification at att.com/PrivacyChoices . Sharing information with other non-AT&T companies or entities There are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include: Complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits.

This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller. Sharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies Sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we provide Wi-Fi services.  In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally. We require that these metrics reports only be used for aggregate insights and that no one attempt to identify any person or device using this information.  Consistent with this Policy, we also require that our metrics reports be handled in a secure manner and that the information included be used only for aggregate insights to enable the marketing or improvement of Products and Services. Sharing Aggregate Insights We may share insights with non-AT&T companies about AT&T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally). Sharing information for research We may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information, and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.

If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy. In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.

No security measures are perfect, however. We can’t guarantee that your information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy. If a breach were to occur, we will notify you as required by applicable law. Close Data storage, transfer, retention and accuracy We take steps to ensure that data is processed according to this Policy and to the requirements of applicable law of your country and of the additional countries where the data is subsequently processed. Data we collect may be processed and stored in the United States or in other countries where we or our affiliates or service providers process data. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure all applicable laws, rights and regulations continue to protect your data. We keep your information as long as we need it for business, tax or legal purposes. We set our retention periods based on things like the type of personal information collected, how long the personal information is needed to operate the business or provide our Products and Services and whether the business is subject to contractual or legal obligations – such as ongoing litigation, mandatory data retention laws or government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation. After that, we destroy it by making it unreadable or indecipherable. Need to update your information? We’re happy to help you review and correct the information we have on your account and billing records. For more information, please see the Contact Us section of this Policy.

All rights reserved. Cookies and Other Technologies Definitions Let's start with what we mean when we use the word \"cookie\" and other related terms: Cookies are small data files. Websites place them in your browser to recognize your computer\n                or\n                mobile device when you return to that site. Cookies are created to keep track of your movements\n                within\n                the site, help you resume where you\n                left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations. There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies: Disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on some websites. You’ll need to\n                    perform the opt out procedure if you opt out of a program or service and then change computers\n                    or\n                    Web browsers, or clear or erase the digital\n                    \"cookie\" that lets us know you opted out. Local Storage Cookies. Local Storage is a convenient, flexible, secure and faster way to\n                    store HTTP state data. It is a method by which our web pages locally store named key/value pairs\n                    in\n                    a user’s web browser. Local storage on\n                    ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage\n                    data\n                    is session-based and will not persist once the session is over and the browser is closed. Flash Cookies (also called Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") are similar to cookies, except\n            that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage,\n            and\n            other similar services. Flash\n            cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not\n            function correctly. While browser cookies may be removed or blocked via web browser settings, flash\n            cookies\n            operate differently. Please note\n            that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the\n            functionality of some Flash applications. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit\n            the Adobe website and make changes\n            at Global Storage Settings Panel . Web beacons are small graphic images on a Web page or in an e-mail. They can be used for things\n            like\n            recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing\n            campaign performs. A widget is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide\n            real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third\n            party\n            and allow them to collect data about\n            users viewing that page. A server log records your web activity by your computer or mobile device and plays a key role in\n            improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search\n            terms\n            you’ve entered, or the links you’ve\n            clicked on. It may also record your browser information, such as your IP address, device type, how long\n            you\n            spend on a Web page, and your browser's cookies. Some websites have “ social network or other third-party plug-ins .” These plug-ins may provide\n            information back to those sites, even if you don't click on or interact with the plug-in. It may also\n            apply\n            even if you don’t have an account\n            with them. Social networks or third parties may use an identifier when transmitting from your browser.\n            This\n            might include information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address and the URL\n            of\n            the web page where the\n            plug-in appears. If you use social networking tools or sites, we recommend you take a moment to\n            familiarize\n            yourself with their privacy policies. Managing Cookies Most browsers will allow you to delete, disable and choose what cookies can be placed on your computer. If\n        you\n        want more information about controlling cookies, visit these sites for the browser you are using: Individual Browsers Internet Explorer » Internet Explorer (Mobile devices) » Safari » Safari Mobile (iPhones\n                and\n                iPads) » Firefox » Firefox (Mobile devices) » Chrome » Chrome\n                (Mobile devices) » Flash Player adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security » × Affiliates Below is a list of some of the affiliates publicly recognized to be part of the AT&T family of companies that\n        have access to information collected from users and subscribers to products, services, apps, websites, or\n        networks provided by AT&T\n        Communications, as set forth in the AT&T Privacy Policy.

Consumers must contact the AT&T residential care center at 1-800-288-2020 and specify each individual\n            member of the household and each associated address to be added to the DNM list. Generally AT&T processes DNM requests within 30 days. However, because our mailings are processed well\n            in advance, you may continue to receive additional offers for some time after the request date.' Please note that AT&T may direct mail market to certain neighborhoods or zip\n                    codes. These offerings are delivered to all homes in a neighborhood or zip code.

DNM requests for an individual consumer at a residential address will remain in effect for THREE years from\n            the date of request. AT&T does not accept DNM requests from third party providers. AT&T DNM requests will expire upon change of address. AT&T will not share or disclose DNM information with any third party other than AT&T vendors responsible\n        for direct mail marketing on AT&T's behalf. Notifications and other non-solicitation mail pieces are exempt from this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM\n        Policy. AT&T reserves the right to discontinue this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy, and may cease\n        accepting DNM requests or otherwise modify this Consumer Marketing Residential DNM policy. × Effective October 10, 2023, we updated this notice to clarify that biometrics may be used to identify individuals doing work for the company. × We are committed to transparency, so we want you to know we’re updating the AT&T Privacy Policy, effective January 1, 2023: We’re making customer choices simpler.

Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among AT&T affiliatesButton Icon , such as DIRECTV and Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your State Data Rights and Choices. We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\\n\\nSharing information with non-AT&T companies that provide services for us or for you\\nWe share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.\\n\\nSharing information with non-AT&T companies to enable Identity Verification\\nWe may share information with non-AT&T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-AT&T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing. If you’re an AT&T Prepaid customer, text “STOP” to 8010 to stop sharing with Identity Verification or “RESUME” to restart sharing at any time. Other customers can opt out of Identity Verification at att.com/PrivacyChoices.\\n\\nSharing information with other non-AT&T companies or entities\\nThere are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include:\\n\\nComplying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits. You can find out more about this in our Transparency Report.\\nDetecting and preventing fraud.\\nProviding or obtaining payment for your service.\\nRouting your calls or other communications.\\nEnsuring network operations and security.\\nNotifying, responding or providing information (including location) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.\\nAlerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services. \\nEnforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property or defending against legal claims.\\nComplying with legal requirements to share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.\\nProviding name and number information for wireline and wireless CallerID and related services, like Call Trace. This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.\\nSharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies\\nSometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we provide Wi-Fi services.  In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally. We require that these metrics reports only be used for aggregate insights and that no one attempt to identify any person or device using this information.  Consistent with this Policy, we also require that our metrics reports be handled in a secure manner and that the information included be used only for aggregate insights to enable the marketing or improvement of Products and Services.\\n\\nSharing Aggregate Insights\\nWe may share insights with non-AT&T companies about AT&T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).\\n\\nSharing information for research\\nWe may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information, and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.\\n\\nSharing information with AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing programs\\nWe may share information with AT&T affiliates and with non-AT&T companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in Privacy Choices and Controls.\\n\\nSharing information to support location services\\nLocation services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  AT&T will not share your location information for location services without your consent (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law. If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy. In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.",
