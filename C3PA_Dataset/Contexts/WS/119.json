You may exercise your right to access and deletion using the buttons at the bottom of this page. Additionally, you may, at any time, send us an e-mail at support@pornhub.com to exercise your above rights in accordance with the applicable legal requirements and limitations. If you are located in the European Economic Area or the UK, you have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. Please note that unless you have created an account with us, we may not have sufficient information to identify you and therefore may not be in a position to respond to your request. Additionally, in some cases in order to adequately verify your identity or your authorization to make the request, we may require you to provide additional information. Note that some requests to delete certain personal information will require the deletion of your user account as the provision of user accounts are inextricably linked to the processing of certain personal information (e.g., your e-mail address). California Rights and Choices The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides you certain rights in relation to your personal information: Right to Know: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our processing of your personal information over the past 12 months, including the specific pieces of information we processed. Right to Request Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information we processed from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the CCPA. Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Rights: We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your rights under the CCPA. To exercise the rights described above, please use the buttons at the bottom of this page or email us at support@pornhub.com with the email subject line “CCPA Request.” In either case you will need to provide the following information to verify your identity and enable us to locate your information in our systems: your username and email address that you used to create an account with us, as well as any other information which we may reasonably request in order for us to verify your identity. We may require you verify that you have access to your account and/or email account that you used to register with us. You can designate an agent to make a request by executing a notarized power of attorney to have that person act on your behalf and providing that person with the information listed above that allows us to verify your identity and locate your information. Alternatively, you will need to directly confirm your identity with us using the methods described above, sign an authorization for the agent to act on your behalf and provide us with confirmation that you have done so. We disclose certain categories of California residents’ personal information for our business purposes, as described in the section above titled Disclosure of Your Personal Information. Resident’s Rights – Jurisdictions in the United States, Where Applicable We do not sell, trade, or exchange the Registered Users’ personal information with anyone for money. Biometric Information We employ third-party service providers to help verify your identity and age and to check background records and the authenticity of identification documents you provide using facial recognition technology. The facial recognition technology creates a mathematical representation of your face and detects facial features from the live scan of your face, your selfie, and the government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us. This mathematical representation, which is considered biometric information/identifier/data under the laws of certain states and countries, is not shared by our service providers with us, and is deleted by our service providers 7 days after its creation. Information derived from this mathematical representation, which may be considered biometric information/identifier/data under the laws of certain states and countries, is shared by our service providers with us as further described below. Your biometric information will be processed to: verify you are a real, live person and to prevent the use of methods which would allow a user to identify as someone else; to match your selfie with your government-issued ID you submit or previously submitted to us to make sure that nobody is impersonating you; to help confirm your age; and to check your criminal/background history. We may disclose your biometric information, face scan, selfie, and government-issued ID (including any government-issued ID or selfie you previously submitted to us) with members of our corporate group, and with third-party service providers. These entities may be located in jurisdictions that do not offer the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. We (and/or any of these entities) may perform facial recognition and process your biometric information from your face scan, selfie, and any government-issued ID, and processing your biometric information for the above purposes. Biometric information shared by our service providers with us will be stored for as long as you have a Pornhub Model Partner Program account.  We will delete your biometric information within three (3) years of you deleting your Pornhub Model account or withdrawing your consent, subject to any legal obligations we might have. You will be asked to provide your consent to biometric processing. You may withdraw your consent to this processing at any time by using the links below. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing or disclosure that occurred prior to the withdrawal. Please note that this section entitled “Biometric Information” applies to relevant users who wish to upload content onto our Websites (through Pornhub’s Model Partner Program for example) but does not apply to identifiers processed by our third-party age verification service providers solely for the purpose of granting you access to our Websites in order to view the contents found thereon. Notice to Law Enforcement The following information serves as a guideline for law enforcement officials seeking disclosure of records. You may serve us a valid court order, subpoena, search warrant or equivalent legal or official administrative document by respecting the following conditions: The document(s) is uploaded, and all required fields have been filed out adequately on our platform for Legal Service Process located at: https://legalservice.aylo.com/legal/datarequest ; The document(s) you are serving is correctly issued by a valid court of law or equivalent legal or administrative authority to us (See Websites’ footer to find our operating entity); The document(s) is also sent by mail at the following address: 195-197 Old Nicosia-Limassol Road, Block 1 Dali Industrial Zone, Cyprus 2540. We reserve the right to refuse online service through our Websites, namely in cases where the above requirements are not met and require formal legal service at the above address. In such event, you will be notified. We may raise or waive any legal objection or right available, in our sole discretion. Transfers of Your Personal Information to Other Countries Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using the Websites you consent to the transfer of information that we process about you, including personal information, to other countries in which we, members of our corporate group (including affiliates and related entities) or our service providers are located. When we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or other regions with comprehensive data protection laws, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with the applicable laws. Where relevant, our transfers outside the EEA are made pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved for use by the European Union. Retention of Personal Information We will only retain your personal information for as long as your account is active, or for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we processed it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider a number of factors, including what personal data we are processing, the risk of harm from any unauthorised disclosure, why we are processing your personal data and whether we can achieve this outcome by another means without having to process it. Where we no longer need to process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your personal information from our systems. Where permissible, we will also delete your personal information upon your request as explained above in the section “Your Rights Related to Your Personal Information” . Third-Party Links and Sites If you click on a link to a third-party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third-party practices. Changes to Our Privacy Policy We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time. If we change anything in our privacy policy, the date of change will be reflected in the “last modified date”. We may attempt to notify you of any material changes as required by law.
