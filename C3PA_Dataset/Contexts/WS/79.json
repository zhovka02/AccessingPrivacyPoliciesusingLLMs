SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT A. You, For Information You Make Available to Us Visitors. When you use our Services as a Visitor, we may ask for information about your preferences and interests to personalize your experience and help you find what you need. All Members. To use many aspects of our Services, you’re required to create a TPT Account and become a Member. To become a Member, we require that you pick a unique username, and provide us with your email address so we can contact you. We may also ask you to tell us your name so we know who you are. We may ask you to share some information about what kind of user you are (your role), your geographic location, what and where you teach, and information about your interests to help us personalize your experience using our Services. Finally, some features of our Service may allow you to upload, create, record, post or otherwise add and/or share Resources or other content (“Content”) through our platform. Sellers. Members who register for one of our Seller Memberships (“Sellers”), will be required to provide additional contact information and set up or connect a payout account to receive Earnings. Sellers can choose to use a name other than their given name as a “Store Name.” A Seller’s Store Name, profile image or logo, and any additional information they choose to provide about themselves in their Store profile will be publicly viewable. To comply with applicable laws, we may collect federal tax identification information from Sellers, including your social security number or employer identification number, to verify your identity and issue tax documents. Purchase information . When you make a purchase through our Services, you’ll need to provide billing and payment information to complete your order. We’ve carefully chosen Service Providers who use Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant practices to process payments (“Payment Processors”). Whether you check out using a credit or debit card, PayPal account, or any other payment method we may support, your payment will be processed directly by our Payment Processor and we’ll never have access to or store your full payment card details. When you use a credit or debit card to pay for your purchases, you’ll be asked to add a credit or debit card payment source (“Payment Card”). When you submit your order, this information will be sent directly to and stored by our Payment Processor. After your payment is processed, the Payment Processor will send TPT some details about the transaction so that we can record your order in our database and provide access to the materials that you purchased. The Payment Card you added will be available for future use on your Account. You can edit or remove this information at any time by navigating to the checkout page or by contacting us for assistance. B. You, For Information Collected Automatically In Connection With Your Use of Our Services When you use our Services as a Member or a Visitor, we receive and collect certain information from your browser and your device such as your Internet Protocol address (IP address), device information, operating system, browser type and version, and browser country location. This information helps us defend against fraudulent activity or attacks, maintain the security of our Services, and improve and personalize your experience. We also log data related to how Members and Visitors use our Services, including Cookies (as defined below) that may uniquely identify your visit or account. This log data includes details such as what pages of our Site or App you visit and when, how users navigate through the Site, and visit referral URLs. This information allows us to better understand how our Services are being used, helps us make improvements, and enables us to personalize your experience with our Services. (Please refer to the Cookies section below for more information about how we use Cookies.) From time to time, we may host and provide Members and Visitors the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, and surveys. If you choose to participate, you may be asked to provide Personal Information which may be used for purposes necessary to administer the contest, sweepstakes, or survey, or for other marketing purposes. C. Third Parties General. We may collect information about you from third parties as permitted by law or through your interaction with third parties we may integrate with from time to time to offer new features and/or services to you (“Third Party Integrations”). We may also receive information about you from third parties such as other Members in connection with our provision of certain services, including for example TPT School Access or gift cards, as well as from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications. Integrations. Third Party Integrations may for example, include your use of certain features allowing you to import or export content to or from TPT or linking an account you have with Google or a supported LMS to TPT. TPT may add or remove Third Party Integrations from time to time. Your use of Third Party Integrations is at your discretion and risk and subject to the Third Party Integration’s terms and privacy policies. Google Drive - Through an integration with Google Drive, you may have the option to list files directly from your Google Drive in your TPT store (“Resources for Google Apps”), or access Resources for Google Apps directly through your Google Drive account (e.g. resources that you have purchased or added to your TPT account for free). To enable your use of this integration, you’ll need to give TPT permission to access your Google Drive for the purposes described in this section. If you’re a Seller listing Resources from your Google Drive, we’ll use this access to list in your TPT store files that you choose from your Google Drive account, set file permissions, make copies for each Member who purchases or accesses your Resources for Google Apps for free, and monitor listed files from your Google Drive for deletions, updates, or changes in permissions so we may be able to alert you or impacted Members. For Members who choose to purchase (or access for free) Resources for Google Apps, we’ll use this access to deliver the Resource to your Google Drive. Use of the integration is subject to Google’s privacy policies — you can find more information about how Google uses your information and what information Google shares with us here . Learning Management Services - you (or your School) may be able to connect to third party Learning Management Services. See our Student Privacy Policy for more detailed information on what information may be collected or shared when using these integrations. External Payment Accounts. If you choose to pay for a purchase using an external account like PayPal or ApplePay, you’ll directly access that account to complete your order and when it’s complete, they’ll send us a confirmation with transaction details so we can record your order and provide access to the Resources or services you’ve purchased. We do not collect information about or have access to the specific payment or funding sources or any other financial account details associated with your PayPal, ApplePay or other similar external accounts. II. HOW WE MAY SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION We disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of third parties including service providers, contractors and other parties: 1. Sellers, When You Place an Order When you place an order on TPT, you’re purchasing from a Seller Member with whom we’ll share order details including what you purchased and your name, city, state, and zip code. 2. The Public or Other Members, When You Connect, Share, or Communicate With Them There may be features of our Services which allow you to: Post, create, upload, record or otherwise add Content (e.g. Resources you publish, Communications such as comments, reviews, questions, or other public or private messages, and materials or media created by use of certain features in Easel such as audio or video recordings) Connect, communicate, and share information with other Members (such as Resource Collections, Member to Member messages, Q&A, and so on) Join and post messages in forums, groups, or communities Join or link your account to another Member (e.g. to login as a VA with Support Access), to an Organization using TPT for Schools or TPT School Access (together “School Account”), or other Services that allow similar account connections Submit requests for Resources or participate in a shared wish list Display a public profile (e.g. by joining as Seller and having a storefront on TPT), and so on By using any of these features, you’re choosing to share information about yourself and/or your TPT account and/or activity with TPT, and you’re directing TPT to make that information available to the public, other Members, and/or your School or Organization as the case may be. To the extent TPT enables Members to send messages directly to other Members, TPT’s Community Guidelines policy applies and TPT may moderate such communications as we deem necessary to enforce our policies and keep TPT a safe place to transact. When you use TPT as a member of a School Account, information about your membership with that School Account is accessible to other members of your School Account and your use of and information related to that School Account will be managed by the School Account administrator. If you link your account for Support Access, please review our VA Login Terms and Conditions for more detail on what information may be shared. If you are a Seller, information from your “Store Profile” section of your Account will be visible to all visitors and Members who visit your store page – this includes your store name (which will be your first and last name unless you choose a different Store Name, any information you add to your Store Profile about your experience, education, and certifications, bio, teaching style and so on). 3. Service Providers & Contractors TPT engages the services of third party companies and contractors (“Service Providers”) to support and help provide certain features of our Services such as, but not limited to, payment processing, hosting, customer support, data storage and analysis, monitoring Site traffic and activity, usability testing and research, error reporting and debugging, communication and content delivery, business operations, advertising, surveys, security and fraud prevention, staff augmentation, and other services. TPT shares data with these Service Providers so that they can perform their services which help deliver our Services more securely, efficiently, and effectively. Service Providers may have access to certain Personal Information in the course of providing their service. Service Providers’ access to your Personal Information is limited to the purpose of providing their services in accordance with an agreement with TPT. Service Providers are not permitted to disclose Personal Information they may process on our behalf to other parties (other than their own service providers as necessary) or use your Personal Information for any other purpose. TPT may, from time to time, share aggregate or de-identified user data with business partners, Service Providers, or other third parties to identify or share trends, usage statistics, and so on. 4. Third Parties, In Connection With a Merger, Acquisition, or Other Change of Control As part of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which a third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part), we may transfer the data we have collected, including Personal Information, to the third party. In such an event, we’ll notify you of that change. In addition, any purchasing company would have to abide by the terms of this Policy including notifying you before making material changes and giving you the opportunity to opt out. 5. Third Parties, For Information Requests and Legal Obligations To the extent you make purchases through the Services using an institution, school, or other third-party entity’s credit or debit card, PayPal account, or any other payment method, and that institution, school, or third party requests such information or information related thereto and TPT, in its sole discretion, determines such request is reasonable, we may choose to provide such information or information related thereto to that institution, school, or third party. Finally, we respect and comply with legal obligations and may release information (including Personal Information and information about your account activities) in cooperation with a law enforcement investigation, in response to a valid legal request such as a court order, legal subpoena, or government inquiry or audit, as part of the process outlined by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), or to defend, protect, or exercise our legal rights. 6. Other Third Parties, At Your Direction. We may share your Personal Information with other third parties as authorized, directed or requested by you. From time to time, we may provide access to Third Party Integrations or otherwise partner with third party companies or organizations including advertisers to provide additional services, products, and offers (collectively “Partners” and “Partner Services”). When you choose to engage with Partners or use Partner Services, you direct TPT to share Personal Information for the purposes of facilitating your use of the Partner Services and the Partner may collect information from you directly by your interaction. When you choose to engage with Partner Services or authorize TPT to share your Personal Information with a third party other than a Service Provider, you understand that Partners and other such third parties are independent of TPT and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party’s collection, use, and sharing practices. You may want to review each such third party’s own privacy notices prior to engaging with them for information on how such third parties will process your information. III. OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY At TPT, we take children’s privacy very seriously. TPT’s Terms of Service require all account holders to be at least 18 years old. Except as otherwise set forth in this section, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you should not use or attempt to use our Services except to complete assignments in Easel by TPT at the direction of your teacher and you should not send any information about yourself to TPT. Except with respect to Student Tools, if we discover that we have collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will take the appropriate measures to promptly remove that information from our Services. To the extent that you use the Student Tools such as Easel by TPT, please visit our dedicated Student Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat the information we collect in connection with the Student Tools, which may include information about children who are under the age of 13. If you believe that TPT may have collected Personal Information about a child under 13 other than through use of our Student Tools, please contact us at support@teacherspayteachers.com to let us know. We’ll work with you to make sure that information is removed from our Site. IV. DATA SECURITY AND RETENTION 1. DATA SECURITY We seek to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Information and how we are processing that data. You can help keep your account secure by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss, or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. 2. ACCOUNT SECURITY Access to your TPT Account is secured by the password you choose. For your security, we store only a hashed version of your password. This means that we don’t know your password and your password isn’t visible to us when members of our team view your Account for example to provide you with support.

When you use our Services as a Visitor, we may ask for information about your preferences and interests to personalize your experience and help you find what you need.\\n\\nAll Members. To use many aspects of our Services, you’re required to create a TPT Account and become a Member. To become a Member, we require that you pick a unique username, and provide us with your email address so we can contact you. We may also ask you to tell us your name so we know who you are.\\n\\nWe may ask you to share some information about what kind of user you are (your role), your geographic location, what and where you teach, and information about your interests to help us personalize your experience using our Services. Finally, some features of our Service may allow you to upload, create, record, post or otherwise add and/or share Resources or other content (“Content”) through our platform.\\n\\nSellers. Members who register for one of our Seller Memberships (“Sellers”), will be required to provide additional contact information and set up or connect a payout account to receive Earnings. Sellers can choose to use a name other than their given name as a “Store Name.” A Seller’s Store Name, profile image or logo, and any additional information they choose to provide about themselves in their Store profile will be publicly viewable.\\n\\nTo comply with applicable laws, we may collect federal tax identification information from Sellers, including your social security number or employer identification number, to verify your identity and issue tax documents.\\n\\nPurchase information. When you make a purchase through our Services, you’ll need to provide billing and payment information to complete your order. We’ve carefully chosen Service Providers who use Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant practices to process payments (“Payment Processors”). Whether you check out using a credit or debit card, PayPal account, or any other payment method we may support, your payment will be processed directly by our Payment Processor and we’ll never have access to or store your full payment card details.\\n\\nWhen you use a credit or debit card to pay for your purchases, you’ll be asked to add a credit or debit card payment source (“Payment Card”). When you submit your order, this information will be sent directly to and stored by our Payment Processor. After your payment is processed, the Payment Processor will send TPT some details about the transaction so that we can record your order in our database and provide access to the materials that you purchased.\\n\\nThe Payment Card you added will be available for future use on your Account. You can edit or remove this information at any time by navigating to the checkout page or by contacting us for assistance.\\n\\nB. You, For Information Collected Automatically In Connection With Your Use of Our Services\\n\\nWhen you use our Services as a Member or a Visitor, we receive and collect certain information from your browser and your device such as your Internet Protocol address (IP address), device information, operating system, browser type and version, and browser country location. This information helps us defend against fraudulent activity or attacks, maintain the security of our Services, and improve and personalize your experience.\\n\\nWe also log data related to how Members and Visitors use our Services, including Cookies (as defined below) that may uniquely identify your visit or account. This log data includes details such as what pages of our Site or App you visit and when, how users navigate through the Site, and visit referral URLs. This information allows us to better understand how our Services are being used, helps us make improvements, and enables us to personalize your experience with our Services. (Please refer to the Cookies section below for more information about how we use Cookies.)\\n\\nFrom time to time, we may host and provide Members and Visitors the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, and surveys. If you choose to participate, you may be asked to provide Personal Information which may be used for purposes necessary to administer the contest, sweepstakes, or survey, or for other marketing purposes.\\n\\nC. Third Parties\\n\\nGeneral. We may collect information about you from third parties as permitted by law or through your interaction with third parties we may integrate with from time to time to offer new features and/or services to you (“Third Party Integrations”). We may also receive information about you from third parties such as other Members in connection with our provision of certain services, including for example TPT School Access or gift cards, as well as from some of our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our websites, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.\\n\\nIntegrations. Third Party Integrations may for example, include your use of certain features allowing you to import or export content to or from TPT or linking an account you have with Google or a supported LMS to TPT. TPT may add or remove Third Party Integrations from time to time. Your use of Third Party Integrations is at your discretion and risk and subject to the Third Party Integration’s terms and privacy policies.\\n\\nGoogle Drive - Through an integration with Google Drive, you may have the option to list files directly from your Google Drive in your TPT store (“Resources for Google Apps”), or access Resources for Google Apps directly through your Google Drive account (e.g. resources that you have purchased or added to your TPT account for free). To enable your use of this integration, you’ll need to give TPT permission to access your Google Drive for the purposes described in this section. If you’re a Seller listing Resources from your Google Drive, we’ll use this access to list in your TPT store files that you choose from your Google Drive account, set file permissions, make copies for each Member who purchases or accesses your Resources for Google Apps for free, and monitor listed files from your Google Drive for deletions, updates, or changes in permissions so we may be able to alert you or impacted Members. For Members who choose to purchase (or access for free) Resources for Google Apps, we’ll use this access to deliver the Resource to your Google Drive. Use of the integration is subject to Google’s privacy policies — you can find more information about how Google uses your information and what information Google shares with us here.\\nLearning Management Services - you (or your School) may be able to connect to third party Learning Management Services. See our Student Privacy Policy for more detailed information on what information may be collected or shared when using these integrations.\\nExternal Payment Accounts. If you choose to pay for a purchase using an external account like PayPal or ApplePay, you’ll directly access that account to complete your order and when it’s complete, they’ll send us a confirmation with transaction details so we can record your order and provide access to the Resources or services you’ve purchased. We do not collect information about or have access to the specific payment or funding sources or any other financial account details associated with your PayPal, ApplePay or other similar external accounts.",
