SEARCH Privacy Policy Effective date: July 1, 2023 The Daily Beast Company LLC has prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand more about how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect about consumers through our web and mobile services, which we refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy only covers information that we collect about you as part of your use of the Services. What information do you collect about me? The information that we collect about you falls into these general categories: • Information that you provide. We may collect information that you choose to provide to us (including content that you submit to us or when you subscribe to our newsletter(s) or provide us with content for our site). This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, postal address, user name, password, and password reminder questions and answers. We may ask you for information when you register or subscribe, or at other times—such as when you enter a contest, take a survey, participate in a promotion, provide content, or order products from us. We may be required by law to collect certain personal data about you or as a consequence of any contractual relationship we have with you. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these obligations. • Automated information. Using technologies that are widely used on the Internet, such as cookies, web beacons, and other technologies (“Cookies”), we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device and online activity when you access the Services. For example, when you visit thedailybeast.com, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and operating system, as well as information about which pages you visit and the page, if any, that referred you to our sites or that you visit after our sites. Similarly, when you use our mobile applications, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as the type of mobile device you use or your device identifier. • Location information. When you use the Services, we may collect information about your location separately from other information that you provide to us explicitly. For instance, we may use your IP address to help determine your geographic location. • Social networking information. If you log-in to The Daily Beast through a social networking account (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may collect information about you from that social networking account, including your name, email address, and other information associated with your social networking account. • Information from other sources. We may combine the information that we collect with information that we obtain from other sources, such as our owners, including IAC, our past and present affiliates, including other IAC companies, and our business partners, licensees, contractors, and service providers. For example, we may ask a service provider to supply us with demographic information or updated contact information for you. For more information about the third parties from which we collect your personal data, please contact us at the contact information below. How do you use this information? We use the information that we collect about you for these purposes: • to contact you to provide information about The Daily Beast or other products or services in which we believe you may be interested, including newsletters, promotional emails, legal notices; • to manage your account; • to provide you with the products and services you request; • to respond to your requests, questions, and comments; • to perform business analyses or for other purposes to improve the quality of our business, the products and services we offer, including through surveys and questionnaires; • to deliver targeted advertising, as described below ; • as we believe is necessary to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our Terms of Use ; • and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.; We also do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate our Services, for other business purposes, and in connection with our display of advertising (which we describe below ). This research is based on the information you provide to us including upon registration during a promotion, in surveys, and on your use of our Services. With whom do you share this information? We may share the information that we collect about you through the Services in these ways: • with authorized service providers that help us provide the Services or perform other business functions for us, such as sending emails or hosting web services (but these service providers are not permitted to use personal data that we provide for any purpose other than to provide service to us); • with our corporate affiliates, licensees, and contractors, including the IAC family of businesses; • in the context of contests or other promotions in which we identify an outside entity, with the identified entity; • to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, in response to a request for cooperation from law enforcement or another government agency, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; • when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law; • to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements, or otherwise protect or defend our rights or property or the rights or property of others, or the safety of the public; • in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale; • in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form; • and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent. In addition, if you provide content to the Services, such as submitting content through the “Your Turn” submission form as a part of The Daily Beast’s paid membership offering, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service. Unless otherwise noted, we do not limit the distribution of information that you share using these features. The Daily Beast has implemented Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use . How do you decide which advertisements to show me on the Services? Some Services are offered to you free of charge because we cover the cost of providing our Services by displaying advertisements. Many of these advertisements are targeted, which means that advertisers tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, men over 25 years old). The targeted ads on the Services may be provided by us, or they may be provided by a third-party vendor. We may use automated decision-making to customize your experience based on your personal information. You can learn more about targeted ads, including how to opt out of receiving them, below . We also participate in affiliate advertising and allow affiliate links to be encoded on some of our pages. This means that we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links and affiliate partners may use cookies to understand your use of the Services. Does this Privacy Policy apply to information collected through third-party offerings? We sometimes partner with third parties that operate platforms or offer services that you can use to access or otherwise interact with our content and offerings. For example, you can access The Daily Beast on your Apple iPad or iPhone. Similarly, we may include in some of our Services features that integrate with third-party social networking services or other third-party services. To do this, we may include in our web pages and apps code from the social networking service provider or other third party. This code may allow the service provider to collect information about your activities. If you are logged into social networking or other third-party services at the time, the service providers may also be able to identify you in connection with that information. Although this Privacy Policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these co-branded offerings, we do not control the privacy practices of our third-party partners. As a result, we want you to be aware that when you use these offerings you may be providing information to both us and our partner, and you should review the partner’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use any data that it collects. The Daily Beast contains links to other sites, including third party payment processors and affiliate marketing links encoded by third parties. Please be aware that The Daily Beast is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal data. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by The Daily Beast. If you choose to purchase a product or service via our site, some special terms apply. Payments are handled by a third party payment processor, whose own terms and privacy policy will govern your transaction. We do not process, record or maintain your credit card, bank account or payment information, though the third party payment processor and/or the merchant may provide us with some data relating to your order, such as what you purchased and how much you spent, etc. We expressly disclaim any and all liability related to your use of any third party payment processor’s system, including its privacy practices. Also, we are not responsible for any fulfillment of product that you purchase from merchants or any issues relating to such product(s) or customer service. How do you protect the security of the information you store? We have in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect through the Services. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us via the Services. How long do you keep the information you collect from me? We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To provide security and business continuity for the activities described in this Privacy Policy, we may make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original data. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data we process, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. In some circumstances we may aggregate and de-identify your information in such a way that you may not reasonably be re-identified by us or any other company in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information. What rights do I have regarding data about me? If you would like to access, review, revise or delete personal data we have collected from you, please contact us as provided below. Your specific rights regarding access, review, revision or deletion of your information is proscribed by local laws. Specific applicable local laws may be outlined below. Legal rights applicable to personal data collected from individuals in the European Economic Area (“EEA”): Pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, natural persons (called data subjects) located in the EEA are afforded certain rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, restrict or object to our use of, and receive a portable copy in a usable electronic format of your personal data. You also may have the right withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us and to lodge a complaint with your local data protection or privacy regulator. If you would like to exercise any of the above rights, and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to honor that request, please send your request in writing to the address below. To assist us in processing your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Your request should include any information relevant to your request, including, without limitation: (i) your name, email and postal address; (ii) the specific right you are asserting (e.g., removal); and (iii) if you are requesting removal, a brief explanation of why you believe such information should be removed. If you are making the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by The Daily Beast’s legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. Do you collect information from children? We do not knowingly collect personal information (as that term is defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database promptly. What are my California privacy rights? You have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended, the “CCPA”) which are explained throughout this California Consumer Privacy Notice (“California Notice”).

Recipients to Which Personal Information is Disclosed We use Service Providers to help us operate our websites and provide other services on our behalf. Our Service Providers only use Personal Information they Collect or Process on our behalf to provide us services. We also disclose Personal information to Third Parties such as advertising networks and analytics providers. For more information on disclosures to Third Parties, see the Selling and Sharing of Personal Information section below. Retention of Personal Information: Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your Personal Information (which includes the categories of Personal Information set forth in the charts above) for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, as required to satisfy any legal, obligations, or as necessary to resolve disputes. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes we process your Personal Information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.

Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”). We will not fulfill your CCPA request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we Collected Personal Information. Please follow the instructions at our Consumer Rights Request page here and respond to any follow up inquiries we may make. Some Personal Information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough Personal Information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s Personal Information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that Personal Information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer Personal Information that we Collect, Process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. To make a request according to your rights to know, to correct, to opt out of Sales and Sharing of Personal Information, or to request deletion of your Personal Information as set forth below, please email us at consumer-rights-request@thedailybeast.com or click here , where you will find a form to complete so that we can verify your identity using your email address and browser ID and fulfill your request as required by the CCPA.

Please note that “Shine the Light” rights and CCPA rights are granted by different laws and must be exercised separately. State Specific Privacy Disclosures This section applies to Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia (“Regulated State[s]”) residents that visit, access or use our Services. You can learn more about: the categories of Personal Data we process here and disclose to Third Parties here , and the purpose for processing your Personal Data here . References to “personal information” in our general privacy notice describe our practices with respect to “personal data,” as defined under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), while references to Personal Data within this section shall have the meaning affixed to it within the statutes of the Regulated States. Capitalized terms defined in Regulated State privacy laws that are used in this section shall have the same meaning as in the Regulated State privacy laws. If you are a resident of a Regulated State, subject to certain conditions and restrictions set out in the CPA, CTDPA, VCDPA, and other applicable laws, you have the following rights with regard to your “personal data” (as defined in the CPA, CTDPA, VCDPA): 1.

However, some of our advertising practices may be considered a “sale” under certain state privacy laws, such as the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act.

Right to opt out of Profiling. You have the right to opt out of Profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. We do not engage in Profiling that results in any legal or similarly significant effects and as such this right is not applicable. 7. Right to appeal.

We use Cookies and other technologies to store information on your computer or mobile device. We use this information for a variety of purposes, such as to remember you when you return to our websites or to identify your activities as you use certain Services. To do this, we may store a unique identifier on your computer or device. As described above, advertising service vendors that serve ads into our sites may also use their own Cookies or identifiers. You may opt out of the browser Cookies delivered through the Services by changing the setting on your browser, such as through Internet Explorer , Google Chrome , Mozilla Firefox , or Apple Safari . Please be aware that this will disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones that we deliver, and that you may not be able to use all of the Services if you do not allow the placement of cookies. We or our third-party partners also may use technologies called web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server. Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We and our partners use web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services and in conjunction with cookies to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you. You may disable our web beacons in email messages by turning off images in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see the instructions for your particular email client for more information. Please also be aware that by turning off images you may not be able to enjoy all of the Services as they were designed to be viewed. Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a "DO NOT TRACK" signal when you visit various websites or use online services. Like many websites, the Site is not designed to respond to "DO NOT TRACK" signals received from browsers. To learn more about "DO NOT TRACK" signals, visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com/ . What choices do I have regarding your use of information about me? Email messages. If you do not wish to receive emailed promotional material from us, you can opt out by clicking the unsubscribe mechanism in our promotional emails or by emailing us at tech@thedailybeast.com . Please note that, even if you opt out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still contact you to provide you with non-commercial messages, such as legal notices. Also, if you opt out, we may not provide to you non-promotional material, such as our emailed newsletters and other content. Google Ads opt out. If you would prefer not to receive advertisements through the Services that are targeted to your interests, you can inform our advertising vendor, Google, Inc., of your preference by clicking the "Opt out" button at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html . You also can manage your advertising preferences at www.google.com/ads/preferences/ . We may use certain web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use our Services. For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through our Services, visit tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout . You may also be able to opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout . Other targeted ads opt outs. In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and https://youradchoices.com/control/ . Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action. Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies. Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement. Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors. Is my data transferred internationally? The Daily Beast Company LLC operates and is based in the United States. If you are using our Services outside the United States, please be aware that information we obtain about you may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions outside your own. By continuing to use our Services and providing your personal information, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to and processed in jurisdictions other than your own.
