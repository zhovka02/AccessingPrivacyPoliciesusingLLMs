What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored? We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites, personal information and non-personal information.  Personal information is information that you may supply to us, as described more fully below, i.e., when you subscribe, place an order, complete a survey, register for a Site or any part thereof, enter a contest, upload content, participate in a community, or provide your e-mail address.  Personal information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, among other things, your name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, credit card, billing and contact information.  Non-personal information includes information that does not personally identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, use of the Sites and the Internet. Personal Information As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personal information to us.  However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal information.  The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personal information. Registration for an account on the Sites Sign up to receive e-mail newsletters or e-mail alerts from us Sign up to receive e-mail offers from The Seattle Times or The Seattle Times partners Request for customer service or other assistance Participation in surveys, panels, or market research Participation in special events and promotions Purchases on the Sites, including subscriptions to The Seattle Times publications and services Posting a resume on the Sites Placing an order for online or print classified advertisements Creating a profile or submitting information to “personals” sections of the Sites Entry in contests or sweepstakes Participation on social media accounts involving The Seattle Times, our Sites and our brands Participation in communities, chat rooms and comment threads, other fora, and other interactive services Submission of user generated content on any part of the Sites that permit it Submission of a job application Any other place on the Sites where you knowingly volunteer personal information Collection of Personal Information From or Through Social Media Sites When you interact with any The Seattle Times property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest, we may collect the personal information that you make available to us on that page or account including your account ID or “handle.” However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal information that we are permitted to collect by these social media platforms.  If you choose to link or login to your The Seattle Times account with or through a social networking service, The Seattle Times and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you view on the Sites, with that social network’s users. Non-Personal Information In addition, when you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually and our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Sites (“Non-Personal Information”). Generally, we collect and store the following categories of Non-Personal Information: Demographic data such as age, gender, and five digit zip code as part of collecting personal information Neighborhood information Device information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites.  This information may include IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. Usage information about your use of the Sites.  This information includes a reading history of the pages you view.  We use this information to provide you a more customized experience on the Sites. Additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses. Your search terms and search results. Other information regarding your use of the Sites. Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information We collect and store your device’s source IP address which may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Sites.  Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data. In addition, in some cases the Sites can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature.  If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device which will be used by the Sites to serve you certain content tied to your location.  If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers. Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information From Other Sources We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources (including by us from our offline interactions with you) to, among other things, enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to better customize your experience on the Sites. Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies and Web Beacons Like many websites, we use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.  You may occasionally get cookies from companies advertising on our behalf.  We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to this cookie policy. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed.  For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at www.allaboutcookies.org. We may also use web beacons or flash cookies.  A web beacon or flash cookie (also known as “action tags”, “tracer tags”, or “single-pixel gifs”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personal information about your use of a given website. We do not share or provide Personal Information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission. We may also use “Web Storage” to store data about your use of our Sites.  Web Storage is a feature in some browsers that permits websites to store data within your browser rather within a cookie.  This should make this data more secure and make your browser perform better.  We do not share or provide Personal Information we may store in Web Storage, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission. We work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize flash or enhanced cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information from us.  They may, however, anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites.  To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp . Is Personal Information Collected From Children? Unless otherwise disclosed during collection and with parent or guardian consent (for instance, in some of the educational areas on our Sites), The Seattle Times does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age you should not provide personally identifiable information to The Seattle Times without providing us with consent from your parents. If The Seattle Times discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided The Seattle Times with personally identifiable information and we do not have parental consent, The Seattle Times will immediately delete that child’s information from the Sites.

We will also disclose Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites. What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure? We are concerned about ensuring the security of your Personal Information.  We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers.  Personal Information collected by our Sites are stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public.  Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you.  Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Your Obligations to Keep Your Access Rights Secure You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by a Website's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or The Seattle Times has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, The Seattle Times has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof).  You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account.

Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for Seattle Times do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites. What About Contests, Sweepstakes or Games? When we run a contest or sweepstakes or game relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.

Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other community areas for more information. Governing Law These Sites are published in the United States. We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of our Sites and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the The Seattle Times services, but our family of Sites are located and targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.  If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to The Seattle Times. Notice to Non-US Users If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the your country to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America. Assignment We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services.  We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites.  As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged.  Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.  Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy. Changes to This Policy As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.  We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.  We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.  We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express consent.

California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt-in to, or opt-out of, this type of sharing. We do not share personal information as defined by California’s “Shine the Light” law with third parties and/or affiliates for such third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please email us at webmaster@seattletimes.com contact us at 206.624.7323 or send us a letter to P.O.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to access and control Personal Information. The CCPA defines “Personal Information” to mean “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered public information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a federal privacy law, such as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act. To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. Right to Information Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected, Sold, and Disclosed. You have the right to receive information regarding the categories of Personal Information we collected, sold, and disclosed.  This information is provided below in our Notice of California Consumer Data Collection and Sharing Practices. Right to Access Information You have the right to request access to Personal Information collected about you and information regarding the source of that information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. Right to Request Deletion of Information. You have the right to request in certain circumstances that we delete any Personal Information that we have collected directly from you. To protect our customers’ Personal Information, we are required to verify your identify before we can act on your request. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response. Right to Information Regarding Participation in Data Sharing for Financial Incentives. You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. We do not have any rewards programs or other financial incentives. Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties. You have the right to opt out of any sale of your personal information by The Seattle Times to third parties. Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of personal information with service providers, who are parties we engage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use the personal information only for that function. Do Not Sell My Personal Information How to Submit a Request. You may submit a request to exercise your rights through any one of three means: By filling out a Consumer Data Request Form available here . By calling us at 206.624.7323 . By emailing us at webmaster@seattletimes.com . Notice of California Consumer Data Collection and Sharing Practices. The following is a description of our data collection practices, including the personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we collect information, and whether we disclose that information to external parties.

The categories of Service Providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in this our Privacy Policy. On certain occasions, we also sell information to third parties. An external party may be considered a third party either because the purpose of sharing is not an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because our contract does not restrict them from using Personal Information for other purposes.

We sell the following information: Personal Identifiers: We provide your contact information to directory services providers and public safety authorities. We provide your IP address and Device ID to our analytics partners. If you make a donation, we provide your donor information to our third party donor partners. We may also disclose information to other external parties who are not listed here when required by law or to protect The Seattle Times or other persons, as described in this Privacy Policy.
