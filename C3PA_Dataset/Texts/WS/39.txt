Scope of Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy is provided by Experian and its subsidiaries that act as a business or controller within the meaning of U.S. state privacy laws, or are controlled by Experian plc and use the Experian name, or that link to this policy. These companies are referred to in this policy as "we" or "us." This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information during the course of providing our services.  It also tells you about the rights and choices you have with respect to personal information we maintain about you. For purposes of this section, the terms “personal information” and “sensitive personal information” encompass the terms “personal data” and “sensitive personal data” and have the meaning provided under U.S. state privacy laws that are inclusive of but not limited to: the California Consumer Privacy Act, California Privacy Rights Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act. The meaning of these terms refer back to terms defined in such state privacy laws and may exclude publicly available, deidentified, and aggregated information; information subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Gramm Leach Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Driver’s Privacy Protection Act; or information that is otherwise exempted or excluded by state privacy laws. To the extent that Experian sells or discloses deidentified patient information which is exempt under certain state laws, it does so pursuant to the deidentification methodology required under these laws.  In accordance with applicable laws, we commit to maintaining and using deidentified data, as that term is defined under applicable law, in accordance with the law. Any users of the services linked to this policy will be referred to as “consumers.” 2.

Privacy Rights Rights Regarding Personal Information Residents of specific states have certain rights with respect to personal information collected and processed under state privacy laws.  You may exercise the following rights, subject to certain exceptions and limitations: Right to Know/Access You have a right to know and access the personal information that Experian maintains about them.  The information required to be disclosed includes the categories of personal information collected, shared, sold, or disclosed; the categories of sources; the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing the personal information, the categories of third parties to whom Experian shared, sold or disclosed the personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information that Experian has collected about you. Right to Delete You have the right to request deletion of the personal information that Experian has obtained or maintains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Right to Correct You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information that Experian maintains about you. Right to Opt-Out You have the right to exercise control over the processing of certain personal information. This includes the right to opt out from the sale, sharing, processing, and use of personal information for sales, certain profiling or targeted advertising, and from the use of sensitive personal information. Opting out also includes your right to limit generation, use, and disclosure of sensitive personal information. You can choose to opt-out of the sale, and/or opt out of processing of data for targeted advertising, and certain profiling activities and limit the use of your sensitive information. This is not related to your credit report, and will not affect your credit score. Right to Opt-Out or Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information Residents of certain states have the right to opt-out of or limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information that Experian has collected or maintains about them.  Opting-out includes the consumer's right to limit generation, use, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about them.

Right to Portability You have the right to obtain a copy of personal information Experian maintains about you in a format that is portable and readily usable.

You may also include any name variations, email addresses and telephone numbers that may be associated with you. Note that we may need to request additional information from you to verify your identity or understand the scope of your request, although you will not be required to create an account with us to submit a request or have it fulfilled. The type of additional information will vary by request. In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the right to know and/or right to deletion, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity . Authorized Agent You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf through the designated methods set forth in this privacy policy where we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. For requests to opt-out of sales and sharing, or to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information, you may designate an authorized agent by submitting a written and signed permission designating such an agent. For requests made by an opt-out preference signal, written permission from the consumer will not be needed. For requests to know/access, requests to delete and requests to correct personal information: (i) receiving a power of attorney valid under the laws of your state from you or your authorized agent; or (ii) receiving sufficient evidence to show that you have: (a) provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; (b) verified your own identity directly with us pursuant to the instructions set forth in this privacy policy; and (c) directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. This may be done by mailing two forms of identification showing your first name, last name and current address and a signed authorization allowing an agent to request information on your behalf. Opt-Out Preference Signals In certain states, consumers may opt out of personal information sales, sharing and targeted advertising by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal.  If you choose to use the GPC signal, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. Your request to opt-out of sale/sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only, unless it is already linked to other personal information. If you would like us to make the connection between your browser and your account, or other personal information that we may hold that is subject to opt out when you send the opt-out of “sale/sharing” of your personal information request or GPC signal and you have not yet opted out of “sale” / “sharing” your personal information, we recommend you send your complete name and mailing address to optout@experian.com. 4.   How Long We Keep Your Personal Information For Generally, we will keep your personal information only as long as we need it to provide the Experian products and services you’ve signed up to or only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. We may also keep it to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes, protect against fraudulent, deceptive or illegal activity and enforce our rights. These reasons can vary from one piece of information to the next and depend on the products or services you’re signed up to, so the amount of time we keep your personal information for may vary. 5.   Data Collection of Minors’ Data We do not collect, sell, share or disclose the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
