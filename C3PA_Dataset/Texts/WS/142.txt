If you no longer want Reverb to use your information, you may close your account and follow the Right to Withdraw Consent described in Section 8. After closing your account, Reverb will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including tax/revenue laws, “Know your Customer” or other regulatory requirements), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy We may amend this Policy at our discretion from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by posting the changes through the Services and sending you an email or message about the changes. Your continued use of our Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date, active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this Policy to check for any changes. 13. International Transfers Reverb operates a global service. By using our Services, you understand that Reverb may share some of the information it collects with its affiliates and third-party partners located outside of your home country for purposes described in this Policy, including for verification of identity, transaction reviews, and payment processing. The United States, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your personal information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country. In particular, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law. To the extent that Reverb is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information: Model Clauses The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses), which provide safeguards for personal information that is transferred outside of Europe. We often use these Model Clauses when transferring personal information outside of Europe. You can request a copy of our Model Clauses by filling out a help ticket. Basis for Processing: Necessary for the Performance of the Contract between Reverb and Users Reverb provides voluntary Services; you may choose whether or not to use the Services. Reverb processes data based on consent of the user; the legitimate interests of Reverb, and/or the necessity of the data for providing the Services that Users are contracting for when they become members of the Website and/or Apps. IF YOU DO NOT CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA IN ORDER TO ACCESS AND USE THE WEBSITE OR APPS, PLEASE DO NOT USE, OR ENGAGE WITH, THE SERVICES. As we operate globally and use technical infrastructure, including Data centers hosting Reverb’s data, in the U.S. to deliver the Services, in accordance with the contract between us (which you agree to by using the Services and agreeing to our Terms of Use), we need to transfer your personal information to the U.S. and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Simply put, we can’t provide you with the Services and perform our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world. 14. Additional Disclosures for U.S. Residents In certain U.S. states, including California, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut you may be entitled to additional rights or disclosures, please see our U.S. Regional Privacy Policy where you can learn more about how we use your information and any additional privacy rights you may be entitled to. 15.
