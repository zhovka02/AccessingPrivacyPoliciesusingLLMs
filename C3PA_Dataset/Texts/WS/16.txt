disclose each category of PI and Sensitive PI in the table to the following categories                     of recipients in a manner that does not constitute Sale or Sharing: To other parties at your direction or through your intentional action To the government or private parties to comply with law or legal process In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or                             asset sale, in which case we will transfer such information to the buyer or successor entity in                             any such corporate transaction In addition, our Vendors and the other recipients listed in the above table may, subject to                             contractual restrictions imposed by us and/or legal obligations, also use and disclose your PI                             for business purposes. For example, our Vendors and the other categories of recipients listed in the table below may engage subcontractors to enable them to perform services for us or process for our business purposes. Processing Purposes Implicating Sale, Sharing, Targeted Advertising, and Profiling When you provide us PI for the following Processing Purposes, we may use and disclose certain                     personal information that you provide for such purposes in a way that may constitute Selling and/or                     Sharing, as well as Processing of your PI for purposes of Targeted Advertising. Providing our products and services Facilitating your relationship with our Third-Party Business Partners For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal information Processing Purposes that may implicate Selling and/or Processing of your PI for Targeted Advertising include the following: Targeting advertisements Facilitating your relationship with our Third-Party Business Partners Ad measurement, attribution, and other ad administration For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your personal information Sources of PI As described in our Privacy Policy , we collect PI directly from you or from your device, Third-Party                     Digital Businesses, Third-Party Business Partners, Vendors, our affiliates and related entities, other                     individuals (e.g., your friends, your family (such as your parents) and others that use the U.S. News                     Services and submit content concerning you or about you) and other third parties. Data Retention Because there are so many different types of PI in certain categories, and so many purposes and use                     cases for different data, we are unable to provide retention ranges based on categories of PI in a way                     that would be meaningful and transparent to you.  Actual retention periods for all PI will depend upon                     how long we have a legitimate purpose for the retention — consistent with the collection purposes and                     applicable law.  For instance, we may maintain business records for so long as relevant to our business,                     and may have a legal obligation to hold PI for so long as potentially relevant to prospective or actual                     litigation or government investigation.  We apply the same criteria for determining if we have a                     legitimate purpose for retaining your PI that you ask us to delete.  If you make a deletion request,                     we will conduct a review of your PI to confirm if legitimate ongoing retention purposes exist, will                     limit the retention to such purposes for so long as the purpose continues, and will respond to you with                     information on any retention purposes on which we rely for not deleting your PI.  For more information                     on deletion requests see the Right to Delete section below. B. CONSUMER RIGHTS REQUESTS As described in further detail below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer                     Request (defined below), we provide Consumers – which are, for clarity, residents of certain states –                     the privacy rights described in this section.  For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights,                     we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests.  For states                     that have passed consumer privacy laws but are not yet in effect as of the Effective Date, we will also                     consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so at our discretion. Making a Request and Scope of Requests As permitted by U.S. State Privacy Laws, any request you submit to us is subject to an identity                     verification process (“ Verifiable Consumer Request ”) as described in the Verifying Your Request section below. We will not fulfill your request unless you have provided sufficient information                     for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI. To make a request, other than a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, please submit your request to                     us by one of the methods below. For instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request,                     please go to the Do Not Sell/Share/Target section below. Email us at privacy@usnews.com Visit our webform Some information we maintain about Consumers that is technically considered PI may nonetheless not be                     sufficiently associated with the information that you provide when making your request. For example, if                     you provide your name and email address when making a request, we may be unable to associate that information                     with certain data collected on the U.S. News Services such as clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous                     browser ID. Where we are unable to associate such information with the information you provide, we are                     therefore unable to associate such information with you and cannot include such information in response                     to those requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. We                     will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make                     the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify PI that we collect, process, store, disclose,                     and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully                     respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon                     a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that                     the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that                     decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will                     charge you for responding to your request. Verifying Your Request When you make a request, we will verify that you are the person you say you are, or, if you are seeking                     information on behalf of another person, that you are authorized to make the request on their behalf (see                     our “Authorizing an Agent” section immediately below). In addition, we will compare the information                     you have provided to us to ensure that we maintain personal information about you in our systems. As                     an initial matter, we ask that you provide us with, at a minimum, your name and email address.                     Depending on the nature of the request and whether we have the email address you have provided in                     our systems, we may request further information from you to verify that you are the Consumer making                     the request. We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to                     provide additional information via e-mail or other means to complete the verification process. We                     will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), Right to Delete,                     or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably                     verify you are the Consumer that is the subject of the request. The same verification process does                     not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of Sensitive PI requests, but we may apply                     authentication measures if we suspect fraud (such as verifying access to the email provided when                     making the request). The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your                     categories requests, certain deletion, and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in                     nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points                     provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the                     purpose of verifying you.  For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate                     to personal information that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a                     verification standard of a reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least                     three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be                     reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under                     penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request. If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested                     information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. State Privacy Laws. For                     example, if you are a California Consumer: If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice                             for a general description of our data practices. If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request. Authorizing an Agent You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the                     manner described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. State                     Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request                     and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized the agent to                     make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer                     gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. State Privacy                     Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us                     that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. Your Consumer Privacy Rights Appeal Rights Residents of certain states have the right to appeal a decision regarding a privacy request. You can                             exercise this right by responding to the email we send containing our response to your request, and                             following the instructions in such email. As of the Effective Date, residents of Colorado, Connecticut,                             and Virginia have this right. Right to Limit Sensitive PI Processing Certain personal information qualifies as sensitive data or Sensitive PI under the U.S. State Privacy                             Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as “Sensitive PI”. If you are a California                             resident, you have the right to direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of Sensitive PI                             if it is used or disclosed beyond certain internal business purposes. Where applicable, we will treat                             such a request as a revocation of any consent that you may have provided to your processing of Sensitive                             PI. Right to Know/Access Right to Know - Categories/Confirmation of Processing If you are a California resident, you have the right to request that we provide you with certain                             information about our collection, use and disclosure of your PI over the 12-month period prior to                             the request date, related to categories of PI. You can request that we confirm whether we are processing                             your personal information, and disclose to you: (1) the categories of PI we collected about you; (2)                             the categories of sources for the PI; (3) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling                             that PI; (4) a list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months and,                             for each category of PI, the categories of recipients; and (5) a list of the categories of PI sold or                             shared about you in the prior 12 months and, for each, the categories of recipients. Right to Know - Specific Pieces You have the right to request a transportable copy of the specific pieces of PI we collected about                             you. In some states, such as California, this includes the right to PI collected in the 12-month period                             preceding your request. Please note that PI is retained by us for various time periods, so there may                             be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and                             thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Based on your state of residence,                             we may apply a limit on the number of “Right to Know” requests you make over a particular time                             period, as permitted under U.S. State Privacy Laws. Right to Delete You have the right to request that we delete any of your PI that we have collected directly from you, subject to certain exceptions which we will explain if they apply. After we confirm that your deletion request is a Verifiable Consumer Request, subject to permitted retention exceptions, we will carry out one or more of the following: (i) permanently erase your PI on our existing systems with the exception of archived or back-up systems, (ii) deidentify your PI, or (iii) aggregate your PI with other information. In our response to your request to delete, we will tell you the method for deleting your PI. Where legal exceptions will apply to your request for deletion, we will tell you which one(s) and will limit retention to the permitted purpose(s). Right to Correct You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal information maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws. Do Not Sell/Share/Target Under the various U.S. State Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. California and certain other states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available PI to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing PI for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of PI under the various U.S. State Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available PI to a third party. Third-Party digital businesses, including social media platforms, analytics companies, data brokers,                             third-party advertisers, and other tech companies that offer digital advertising services (“ Third-Party Digital Businesses ”) may associate cookies, web beacons (also known as pixel tags) and other similar technology (“ Tracking Technologies ”) on the U.S. News Services that collect PI when you use or access the U.S. News Services, or otherwise                             collect and process PI that we make available about you, including digital activity information.                             Giving access to PI on the U.S. News Services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could                             be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate Targeted Advertising under some state laws. Therefore,                             we will treat such PI collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and                             other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the                             opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the PI we make available about you is collected                             directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on the U.S. News Services                             or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “ cookie PI ”). However, certain PI which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information                             that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address                             (which we refer to below as “ non-cookie PI ”). For information regarding other categories of third parties to which we may sell/share your PI,                             see the table above in the PI COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURES section above. When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of                             Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all                             of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below. Opt-out for non-cookie PI : If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g.,                             your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make                             an opt-out request on our webform . Opt-out for cookie PI : If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the sale/sharing of such PI, you can exercise an opt-out request by visiting our webform and following the instructions. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites and apps you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use.  Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. Your Additional Cookies Choices Third-Party Digital Businesses may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to recognize your device and/or to collect and record information about your visits to the U.S. News Services and other websites, so that they can facilitate feature functionality, measure the effectiveness of ads, track page usage and paths followed during visits, and provide interest-based advertisements to you. These companies may provide this data to us. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about certain kinds of online interest-based advertising, please visit National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt Out , Digital Advertising Alliance Your AdChoices , or AdChoices for your mobile device . U.S. News does not provide any assurances that these third-party tools, programs or statements are complete or accurate. Some of the U.S. State Privacy Laws also require us to state that we do not knowingly Sell or Share the PI of Consumers under 16. Opt-Out Preference Signals (Also Known as Global Privacy Control or “GPC”) Some of the U.S. State Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which are referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”). GPC signals are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of Sale, Sharing and/or Targeted Advertising, such that the GPC signal effectively automatically communicates such requests. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. To our knowledge, we have configured our websites to receive and honor GPC signals pursuant to the specification and implementation instructions at https://globalprivacycontrol.org .  We will apply GPC signals as a Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests as to cookie PI. Due to technical limitations, we are unable to apply GPC signals to non-cookie PI; however, you can make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request as to non-cookie PI at our webform as just described above. Notably, when you are visiting our website on a particular device and browser, we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target as to cookie-PI only to that specific device and browser. You must re-enable GPC if you visit our website on a different device and/or browser. We are required by certain U.S. State Privacy Laws to state that we do not : (1) charge a fee for use of our websites if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our websites if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC (except that we may from time-to-time display on our website or consent management platform that you have enabled GPC). Automated Decision-Making and Profiling We may engage in processing that constitutes automated decision-making or profiling under the CCPA. However, as of the Effective Date, the definitions of these concepts, and any associated opt-out and access rights have not been added to the updated regulations of the CCPA. We do not believe we carry out profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. If we change our practices, we will change this policy and provide you with the right to opt-out of such activities as required by the applicable U.S. State Privacy Laws, subject to any applicable exceptions. Right to Non-Discrimination; Incentive/Loyalty Programs You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment, in a manner prohibited by U.S. State Privacy Laws, for the exercise of your privacy rights. We collect and use your PI to administer and maintain incentive/loyalty programs that may constitute                         a “financial incentive,” “price or service difference,” or “bona fide loyalty program” as defined                         under the U.S. State Privacy Laws.  For a description of our current loyalty/incentive programs,                         including how to opt-in to or withdraw from such programs, and the basis for valuing your PI in                         connection with program benefits, click here . Please note that participating in our incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to                         affirmatively opt-in to the programs to participate. Additionally, any opt out instructions are                         available in the link above. We may add or change incentive programs by posting a notice on the program                         descriptions linked to above, so check them regularly. Ours and Others' Rights Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may collect, use, and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your rights under U.S. State Privacy Laws. In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party’s rights or conflict with applicable law. C. OTHER CALIFORNIA NOTICES In addition to CCPA rights, certain Californians are entitled to certain other notices, including those described below. Third Party Marketing and Your California Privacy Rights California's "Shine the Light" law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of PI to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. Separate from your CCPA rights described above, you have the following additional rights regarding disclosure of your information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. We may from time to time elect to share certain "personal information" (as defined by California's "Shine the Light" law) about you with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us to, under certain circumstances, request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If this applies, you may obtain the categories of personal information shared and the names and physical addresses of all third parties that received personal information for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in 2023 will receive information about 2022 sharing activities). To make such a request, please provide sufficient information for us to determine if this applies to you, attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California physical address. You may make this request by contacting us at privacy@usnews.com . Any such request must include "Shine the Light California Privacy Rights Request" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year. As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately. California Minors Although the U.S. News Services are intended for an audience over the age of 18, any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the U.S. News Services, and who posted content or information on the U.S. News Service, can request removal by contacting us at privacy@usnews.com , detailing where the content or information is posted and attesting that you posted it. We will then make reasonably good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it, so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control. D. NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS Users of the U.S. News Services, who are Nevada consumers, have the right to submit a verified request that the U.S. News Services not sell such Nevada consumer's covered information. Such right is further described, and the terms are defined, in Nevada Revised Statutes 603A (the "Nevada Internet Privacy Law"). The U.S. News Services do not currently sell any covered information as defined in the Nevada Internet Privacy Law. Nevada consumers may register an email address to which identity verification instructions will be delivered if the U.S. News Services begin selling covered information, as defined by the Nevada Internet Privacy Law, in the future. Any Nevada consumer who wishes to so register should send his/her email address and a request to register to privacy@usnews.com with "Nevada Do Not Sell Request" in the subject line and the message of the email. Should a Nevada consumer's registered email address subsequently change, such Nevada consumer must contact privacy@usnews.com to inform the U.S. News Services of such change (specifying the Nevada consumer's old and new email addresses), as the U.S. News Services will not search any other records in the event a registered email address is no longer valid.
