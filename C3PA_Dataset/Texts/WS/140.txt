In-App Tracking Methods There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs,” or may use “SDKs,” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices. SDKs are blocks of code that may be installed in our mobile application by third party companies with which we work.

These companies use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Service and Digital Properties and elsewhere on the Internet, sometimes known as “interest-based advertising” and “online behavioral advertising (“Interest-based Advertising”) which may include sending you an ad on another online service after you have left the Service or Digital Properties (i.e., “retargeting”).

We use social media Tracking Technologies (such as the Meta Pixel and/or related Meta business tools) that may allow third parties, including Meta, to collect or receive information from our Services, Digital Properties, and/or elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads. In addition, we may serve ads on other online services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched List Ads”). This is done by using Tracking Technologies or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the other online services. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Meta or Twitter and other third-party services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. Most third party social media companies (such as Meta and Twitter) will generally enable you to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Meta ad, or go to your social media account settings, and find out what options you have to control such ads.  We are not responsible for such third parties’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions, they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you. Your choices regarding Tracking Technologies . Some of the companies that perform advertising-related services may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out programs. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). For more information about the NAI including how consumers can opt-out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices . Opting out of Interest-based Advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only Interest-based Advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser, or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time. However, you may be able to refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website(s) functionality may be impaired. If you change Devices or browsers, or use multiple Devices or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each Device or browser. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies. G.
