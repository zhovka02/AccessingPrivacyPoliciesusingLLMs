For residents of the State of California, please click here to find out more about your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“ CCPA ”). I. Introduction This brief summary of certain information in this Policy is intended to help you quickly understand who ZoomInfo is, how you can opt-out of our database, and the potential outcomes of remaining in our database. ZoomInfo collects business contact and similar information related to individuals when they are working in their professional or employment capacity, and uses this information to create professional profiles of individuals and profiles of businesses. We provide this information to our customers, who are businesses trying to reach business professionals for their own business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities. You can opt out of our database by visiting our Privacy Center . At the Privacy Center you can also submit an access request or claim your professional profile and update your profile information. Using the Privacy Center is the quickest and easiest way to access your information or have it deleted or corrected. However, if you prefer to email or call us, our contact information is listed under the “Contact Us” section at the end of this Policy. By remaining in our database, you may be contacted by our customers when they are conducting their business-to-business sales, marketing, and recruiting activities. Communications you receive from our customers may be relevant to your profession or employment role, but we cannot guarantee that you will find such communications to be relevant or of interest to you. II. How we Collect Information A. Where does ZoomInfo get the Business Information for its Business Profiles? ZoomInfo creates profiles of business people and companies, which we call “ Professional Profiles ” and “ Business Profiles ,” respectively. Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we may combine multiple data points regarding a single person or company into a Professional or Business Profile. The resulting directory of Professional and Business Profiles (the “ Directory ”) is then made available to the users of the Site and our customers and strategic partners. Business Information that may be provided in a Professional Profile includes name, email address including business and/or other email addresses (including “freemails” such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), job title and department, phone number (general or direct business numbers, faxes, and/or mobile numbers), company name, postal address of company and business-related postal address of the person, employment history, and education history. Business Profiles may also include links to articles by, about, or quoting an individual, and links to an individual’s social media profiles. ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Business Profiles in several ways, including: Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly-available information. We license information from other companies. Our users and customers contribute information about themselves or other people and companies. Through market research surveys, phone interviews, and other research conducted by our in-house research team. ZoomInfo also makes certain limited Business Information from its Professional Profiles publicly available in our directory pages on our Site (the “ Public Directory ”). The categories of Business Information that may be made available in the Public Directory include past or current name, company, company headquarters telephone number, office address, job title, and/or education information. B. How does the ZoomInfo Community Edition and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work? ZoomInfo offers a service called ZoomInfo Community Edition (“ Community Edition ”). To subscribe to Community Edition, a user must install software offered on the Site known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the “ Software ”) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to the user’s email account. When a user installs the Software or otherwise provides ZoomInfo access to an email account, the user allows ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that the user’s computer uses to manage the user’s email and contacts, known as an “email client” (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g., Google Apps). If required to access this Business Information stored on the user’s computer’s email and contact application(s), the user may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information. We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory. In exchange for allowing this access, the user receives a subscription to Community Edition at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at /about-zoominfo/ce-terms-conditions ). Information that may be collected from the user’s email client includes the following, if available: Name Email address Job title and department Phone numbers (general or direct business numbers, faxes and/or mobile numbers) Company name Postal address of company Business related postal address of person Corporate website URLs Social media URLs Metadata such as Internet Protocol addresses, the dates email messages are sent or received, and subject line information Email addresses, names, and job titles of recipients and senders To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps: Business Information Only – Emails sent to Community Edition users from consumer-oriented email services (or “freemails”) such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo, are disregarded. Unattributed – We do not disclose who contributed particular information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods, except as discussed below. (See “Disclosures to Service Providers,” “Disclosures for Legal Reasons,” and “Disclosures to a Buyer of the Company”) Opt Out – Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web, or a toll-free number. We will fulfill such requests as promptly as we can, and in any event within any time period that may be required by applicable law. ZoomInfo does not “read” the body of email messages; our technology automatically extracts only the data we describe in this Policy. We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in the email client. Information extracted may continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed or the user continues to allow ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account. To stop sharing information with ZoomInfo, a user can uninstall the Software at any time or disable ZoomInfo’s access to the user’s email account through the user’s email account settings. C. Customer Information Customer Information Collected.

The right to request data erasure . Individuals have the right to have their data erased from our Site if the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, they withdraw consent and no other legal basis for processing exists, or their fundamental rights to data privacy and protection outweigh our legitimate interest in continuing the processing. The right to object to our processing .

When ZoomInfo is a Controller .

In those circumstances, we are acting as the data processor, and receive personal information as agents of our customers merely for processing as instructed by our customers. Our customers are solely responsible for determining whether and how they wish to use our Services, and for ensuring that all third-party individuals that are a visitor to or user of a website, application, or service on which a customer uses our Services have been provided with adequate notice regarding the processing of their personal information, have given informed consent where such consent is necessary or advised, and that all legal requirements applicable to the collection, use, or other processing of personal information through our Services have been met by such customers.

Privacy Shield Frameworks While ZoomInfo continues to be certified by and adhere to the principles of the Privacy Shield Frameworks, in light of the Court of Justice of the European Union decision regarding the legal effect of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, ZoomInfo does not rely upon the Frameworks to ensure the lawful transfer of data from EEA to non-EEA countries.

EU and Swiss citizens may choose to opt-out of such disclosures. ZoomInfo may have liability to individuals in case of failure to comply with the law or this Policy in handling onward transfer of such individuals’ information to third parties.
