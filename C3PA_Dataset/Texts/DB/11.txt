What is our legal basis for processing personal information? Our legal basis for collecting and processing personal information depends on the personal information concerned, the context in which we collect it and the applicable laws and regulations. Generally, we collect personal information from you where: we have your consent to do so; we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for example, your subscription to one of our products) where permitted under applicable data protection laws; or, in some jurisdictions such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms or the processing is otherwise consistent with applicable law. In some cases, we are required by law to collect personal information from you. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will inform you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory and the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information. Where we send you marketing or promotional e-mails regarding our Services from our different divisions and affiliates, we do so based on your consent, if required by applicable law. Generally, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), this interest is to provide our Services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest (e.g., when responding to your queries, improving our Services, processing payments, advising you of product features or new releases, providing training, informing you of product maintenance, or undertaking marketing activities). For the legal basis on which we rely in relation to personal information in our products, please see "How does S&P Global use personal information in products?". How does S&P Global use cookies and similar tracking technology? Generally, we use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, "Cookies") in certain Services (in particular our websites and some mobile applications) to collect and use personal information about you, in order to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of our Services, to help us tailor content or offers for you, and to serve our targeted, interest-based advertising.

We will notify you about any security incident involving your personal information through email, correspondence, telephone, push notification or other means, as required by applicable law. If you think your data is the subject of a security incident and we have not notified you, or if you are concerned about the security of your data, please contact our dedicated security team at security@spglobal.com . How does S&P Global treat international data transfers? Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed outside, the jurisdiction in which you reside. These other jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence (and, in some cases, not as protective). S&P Global is a multi-national group with headquarters in New York, United States of America. Our servers may be located outside of the jurisdiction where we collected the data. We may store and replicate your personal information on servers in other jurisdictions, in order to provide speed of access, robustness and protection against server failure. When we collect your personal information, we may transfer it to or from any of the countries in which we do business. Our group companies, related companies, any organization that arranges your access to our products or services service providers, product content providers and business partners, with whom we may share personal information, are located in and transfer personal information to various jurisdictions around the world. The principal jurisdictions where personal information is hosted by or on behalf of S&P Global are the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Italy, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, India and Singapore. In some cases, your personal information may also be accessed from outside of the jurisdiction where we collected the data, such as the Philippines, India and Pakistan, where our back-office support personnel are located for certain Divisions. Where your personal information is transferred by us or on our behalf, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with this Policy. These safeguards include implementing applicable standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require group companies to protect personal information they transfer from the jurisdiction in which it was collected in accordance with applicable data protection law. Where required by applicable law, international transfers take place only when there is an adequate level of protection to the fundamental data protection rights of individuals. In some circumstances, we may choose to rely upon an adequacy decision to lawfully transfer personal information. Standard contractual clauses are one of several mechanisms that allow for personal information to be transferred across jurisdictional borders and we my rely on these for transfers to and from our affiliates, vendors and business partners where applicable. Additional safeguards may also be implemented where personal information is transferred. Please contact us to request a copy of our appropriate safeguards. For how long does S&P Global retain personal information? Our applicable information governance policies, procedures and standards require that personal information be retained for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a Service you have requested, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). Once we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your personal information, our applicable information governance policies, procedures and standards require that we either delete or anonymize your personal information, or if deletion or anonymization is not possible, then pseudonymize and/or securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If you have any questions or require any further information about the period of time for which we will process your personal information, please contact us using the contact details set out below. What are your data protection rights?

Please note, if you revoke your consent for the processing of personal information then we may no longer be able to provide you services. Please note, not all of the rights described above are absolute, and they do not apply in all circumstances.

We will not discriminate against individuals who exercise their privacy rights under applicable law. You may use this Personal Information Request Form or call us on 1-855-529-1761 to exercise any of your rights.

If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual, you must provide all requested information establishing your authorization as an agent to act on another person’s behalf. If you are not satisfied with our response, and are in the European Union or United Kingdom, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

Markit Digital's advertising services never collect financial account information or any Directly Identifying Personal-Information for advertising purposes. In some circumstances, Markit Digital collects information for use in tailored ads shown within the same browser. Markit Digital is a member of the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) and the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau) and abides by the NAI code of conduct and IAB requirements. Collection and Use of Personal Information Advertisements served from our advertising domain, ad.wsod.com, do not collect Directly Identifying Personal-Information. Collection, Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information While advertisements served from ad.wsod.com do not collect information that can directly identify an individual, the system does collect information including the time and date of an ad served, the type of browser and operating system used, the visitor's IP address, and the URL visited. Additional information may be provided by publishers, advertisers, or third parties. This information is not used to identify anyone personally; it is used for aggregated analytic reports, targeting a Tailored Advertising experience, and for the purpose of site administration and diagnostics. This information may be shared with advertising clients or their business partners at their direction. Collection of Non-Personal Information on Mobile Devices Markit Digital may receive non-personal information, such as device information and cookie identification from third party sources, including Apple IDFA, Google AdID, and Android ID. Use of Cookies. Advertisements served from ad.wsod.com set and use cookies and local storage, when appropriate. The ad server uses cookies/local storage to avoid additional database look-ups, but does not use any other systems for persistently identifying users between views and visits. Cookies and all data collected from ad.wsod.com is advertiser-specific and is not shared between multiple advertisers, who may also be serving ads from the domain. An advertiser's data belongs to that advertiser, as the system used to serve ads from ad.wsod.com merely collects and temporarily stores that data for Tailored Advertising. Attribution cookies from Markit Digital's advertising services expire 30 days after the user's last attribution event. Tracking cookies expire after 60 days; after that time a tracking cookie is no longer valid and a new one is created. Opt-out settings in any cookies, along with assigned segments, expire after five years (less intervening leap-year days). Data Retention Markit Digital retains unidentifiable user-level information collected by our advertising system for up to 2 years in both aggregated and un-aggregated forms.

If we are made aware that we have received information from someone under 16, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records. Opting Out of Tailored Advertising (TA) Tailored Advertising (TA), also known as Interest-based Advertising (IBA) or Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) – is the process of targeting specific advertisements to each individual user, based on browsing history. If you opt-out of Tailored Advertising from our service using the tools below, the cookie and any local storage we use to contain this information will be emptied and changed to a placeholder signaling that you have opted-out. If you delete the placeholder cookie or locally-stored code, clear all cookies or local storage, or reset or reinstall your browser, you will need to opt-out again. Cookies and local storage data are browser- and device-specific, so you will need to opt-out from within each browser and computer/device, if you regularly use more than one. After opting-out, you may continue to see digital advertising from us, but it will no longer be targeted to you based on your browsing history. Opting-out does not necessarily delete or replace all cookies or local storage from our domain; some may remain which are used for aggregate reporting on the performance of the advertisements we serve. Consumer Opt-Out The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) provides information to help you learn more about online advertising ( http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising ), as well as a service to help you opt out of interest-based advertising from many organizations ( http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ ).

Legal basis for processing personal information Legal basis for processing personal information What is our legal basis for processing personal information? Our legal basis for collecting and processing personal information depends on the personal information concerned, the context in which we collect it and the applicable laws and regulations. Generally, we collect personal information from you where: we have your consent to do so; we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (for example, your subscription to one of our products) where permitted under applicable data protection laws; or, in some jurisdictions such as the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms or the processing is otherwise consistent with applicable law. In some cases, we are required by law to collect personal information from you. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will inform you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory and the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information. Where we send you marketing or promotional e-mails regarding our Services from our different divisions and affiliates, we do so based on your consent, if required by applicable law. Generally, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), this interest is to provide our Services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest (e.g., when responding to your queries, improving our Services, processing payments, advising you of product features or new releases, providing training, informing you of product maintenance, or undertaking marketing activities). For the legal basis on which we rely in relation to personal information in our products, please see "How does S&P Global use personal information in products?".

We will notify you about any security incident involving your personal information through email, correspondence, telephone, push notification or other means, as required by applicable law. If you think your data is the subject of a security incident and we have not notified you, or if you are concerned about the security of your data, please contact our dedicated security team at security@spglobal.com . International data transfers International data transfers How does S&P Global treat international data transfers? Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed outside, the jurisdiction in which you reside. These other jurisdictions may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence (and, in some cases, not as protective). S&P Global is a multi-national group with headquarters in New York, United States of America. Our servers may be located outside of the jurisdiction where we collected the data. We may store and replicate your personal information on servers in other jurisdictions, in order to provide speed of access, robustness and protection against server failure. When we collect your personal information, we may transfer it to or from any of the countries in which we do business. Our group companies, related companies, any organization that arranges your access to our products or services service providers, product content providers and business partners, with whom we may share personal information, are located in and transfer personal information to various jurisdictions around the world.

In some cases, your personal information may also be accessed from outside of the jurisdiction where we collected the data, such as the Philippines, India and Pakistan, where our back-office support personnel are located for certain Divisions. Where your personal information is transferred by us or on our behalf, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with this Policy. These safeguards include implementing applicable standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require group companies to protect personal information they transfer from the jurisdiction in which it was collected in accordance with applicable data protection law. Where required by applicable law, international transfers take place only when there is an adequate level of protection to the fundamental data protection rights of individuals. In some circumstances, we may choose to rely upon an adequacy decision to lawfully transfer personal information. Standard contractual clauses are one of several mechanisms that allow for personal information to be transferred across jurisdictional borders and we my rely on these for transfers to and from our affiliates, vendors and business partners where applicable. Additional safeguards may also be implemented where personal information is transferred. Please contact us to request a copy of our appropriate safeguards.

Once we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your personal information, our applicable information governance policies, procedures and standards require that we either delete or anonymize your personal information, or if deletion or anonymization is not possible, then pseudonymize and/or securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Markit Digital's advertising services never collect financial account information or any Directly Identifying Personal-Information for advertising purposes. In some circumstances, Markit Digital collects information for use in tailored ads shown within the same browser. Markit Digital is a member of the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) and the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau) and abides by the NAI code of conduct and IAB requirements. Collection and Use of Personal Information Advertisements served from our advertising domain, ad.wsod.com, do not collect Directly Identifying Personal-Information. Collection, Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information While advertisements served from ad.wsod.com do not collect information that can directly identify an individual, the system does collect information including the time and date of an ad served, the type of browser and operating system used, the visitor's IP address, and the URL visited. Additional information may be provided by publishers, advertisers, or third parties. This information is not used to identify anyone personally; it is used for aggregated analytic reports, targeting a Tailored Advertising experience, and for the purpose of site administration and diagnostics. This information may be shared with advertising clients or their business partners at their direction. Collection of Non-Personal Information on Mobile Devices Markit Digital may receive non-personal information, such as device information and cookie identification from third party sources, including Apple IDFA, Google AdID, and Android ID. Use of Cookies. Advertisements served from ad.wsod.com set and use cookies and local storage, when appropriate. The ad server uses cookies/local storage to avoid additional database look-ups, but does not use any other systems for persistently identifying users between views and visits. Cookies and all data collected from ad.wsod.com is advertiser-specific and is not shared between multiple advertisers, who may also be serving ads from the domain. An advertiser's data belongs to that advertiser, as the system used to serve ads from ad.wsod.com merely collects and temporarily stores that data for Tailored Advertising. Attribution cookies from Markit Digital's advertising services expire 30 days after the user's last attribution event. Tracking cookies expire after 60 days; after that time a tracking cookie is no longer valid and a new one is created. Opt-out settings in any cookies, along with assigned segments, expire after five years (less intervening leap-year days). Data Retention Markit Digital retains unidentifiable user-level information collected by our advertising system for up to 2 years in both aggregated and un-aggregated forms.

If we are made aware that we have received information from someone under 16, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records. Opting Out of Tailored Advertising (TA) Tailored Advertising (TA), also known as Interest-based Advertising (IBA) or Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) – is the process of targeting specific advertisements to each individual user, based on browsing history. If you opt-out of Tailored Advertising from our service using the tools below, the cookie and any local storage we use to contain this information will be emptied and changed to a placeholder signaling that you have opted-out. If you delete the placeholder cookie or locally-stored code, clear all cookies or local storage, or reset or reinstall your browser, you will need to opt-out again. Cookies and local storage data are browser- and device-specific, so you will need to opt-out from within each browser and computer/device, if you regularly use more than one. After opting-out, you may continue to see digital advertising from us, but it will no longer be targeted to you based on your browsing history. Opting-out does not necessarily delete or replace all cookies or local storage from our domain; some may remain which are used for aggregate reporting on the performance of the advertisements we serve. Consumer Opt-Out The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) provides information to help you learn more about online advertising ( http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising ), as well as a service to help you opt out of interest-based advertising from many organizations ( http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ ).
