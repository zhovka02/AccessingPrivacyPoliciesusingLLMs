In such cases, SimioCloud will retain only the minimum amount of information that does not qualify for a statutory or regulatory exception, and only use the remaining data for the purposes provided by the statutory or regulatory exception.

Other Important Information Accuracy: SimioCloud maintains quality control procedures to ensure the information we compile and process is as accurate and complete as possible. SimioCloud responds promptly to questions from clients and consumers about the accuracy of information. Security: SimioCloud maintains security procedures designed to keep information we own, license and process from being accessed by any unauthorized person or business. We use a variety of multi-level security systems to control access to our products and services. All users at client locations, as well as all SimioCloud associates, must have the appropriate access codes and be authorized to access certain data and applications. SimioCloud conducts risk assessments and regular audits on our internal and external information systems to assess our ability to maintain the integrity of client and SimioCloud data. Our enterprise security operations center maintains real-time monitoring for information system vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts into our internal systems. We also maintain physical security for our facilities and limit access to certain critical areas of our business. We take reasonable precautions to ensure that our security procedures are adequate for the protection of our computer systems and data, but this does not eliminate the possibility that our security will be breached. If a security breach causes SimioCloud leadership to believe individual consumers are at actual risk for identity theft or other fraudulent activities that may cause substantial harm or inconvenience to consumers or if such breach otherwise requires public notification, SimioCloud will post a security alert notice on our website (www.simiocloud.com) that will provide relevant information for consumers and SimioCloud clients to consider to protect against fraudulent and other harmful actions that may result from the unauthorized access. Privacy Policy Changes: From time to time SimioCloud may update and revise our privacy policy based on changes in our business environment and changes to applicable law. We urge consumers and clients to periodically visit our website to understand any changes that may have occurred. Our privacy policy contains an “effective date” reflecting when the last changes occurred.
