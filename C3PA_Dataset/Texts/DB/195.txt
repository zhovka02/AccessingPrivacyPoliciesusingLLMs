Data IP address An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to each device connected to a computer network that allows the device to communicate on the Internet. Most IP addresses are dynamic, meaning they change every time the device is restarted.

While using these mechanisms may prevent Interest-based Advertising or the sale of your Personal Information, there are no mechanisms for preventing advertising altogether. Opting Out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising Readers can choose to opt out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising activities on their browser(s) or device(s). For more information on how to opt-out of the sale of personal information, please see the section, “Exercising California Privacy Rights” located in the “Country and US State Specific Disclosures” section, below or our webform found in the Privacy Center . Your opt-out choice will apply to the browser or device where you make the choice. This means that Sovrn will not deliver Interest-based Advertising to this browser or device and we will not otherwise use or transfer data collected on this browser or device for Interest-based Advertising. To simplify the management of Interest-based Advertising preferences, Sovrn participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) AdChoices program that allows a user to manage their Interest-based Advertising preferences across all participating DAA members. The DAA provides two tools, WebChoices to manage preferences on web browsers, and AppChoices to manage preferences on mobile platforms like Android or Apple iOS devices. Readers who wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from a browser for Interest-based Advertising purposes can visit https://www.aboutads.info/ to learn more about Interest-based Advertising and to exercise opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other companies participating in the DAA’s self-regulatory program. Readers who wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from apps on a mobile device for Interest-based Advertising purposes can download the DAA’s AppChoices. When using DAA’s opt-out tools, choice will be effective only on the browser or device where choice has been exercised. If using a different device or browser, the opt-out choice(s) will need to be renewed for the new device or browser. Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based, so that an opt-out choice can only be honored if a browser is set to accept third-party cookies. If the opt-out cookie is deleted, then the opt-out choice(s) must be renewed. Sovrn also participates in the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) YourOnlineChoices program which allows Readers in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, or the United Kingdom to exercise their choice with respect to the collection and use of data for Interest-based Advertising purposes and the transfer of such data to Third Parties for Interest-based Advertising. Readers may exercise their choices by visiting the Your Online Choices web portal. Opting out of Interest-based Advertising prevents the collection of Personal Information, but does not prevent data collection of Non-Personal Information.  We may continue to collect, use and transfer such Non-Personal Information for other purposes such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website, fraud prevention, or improving site performance. Opting out also will not stop advertising from appearing in a browser. After opting-out, Readers may receive advertising from Sovrn Services when visiting websites of a Publisher who uses our Services, but that advertising will not be interest-based. After opting out of Sovrn’s Interest-based Advertising, Readers may also continue to receive Interest-based Advertising through other companies.

Only personal information collected through Sovrn Services, where Sovrn has a license to further disclose personal information to third parties, is included in our commercial Data so that Publisher personal information provided for account management is not ‘sold’ or ‘shared’ as defined under California privacy laws. The following summarizes the personal information we collect, or have collected, by reference to the categories specified under California privacy law.  Examples in the list refer to the types of personal information described in the general Privacy Policy. To request information on specific pieces of personal information we may hold about a California consumer, please follow the instructions provided in the Exercising California Consumer Rights section below.
