What Privacy Rights Do You Have? If you are located in a jurisdiction with data protection laws that provide individuals with certain rights, such as Europe or the State of California, some or all of the rights described below may be available to you regarding your personal data held by us. When our role is limited to data processor or service provider, then you must contact that Customer to exercise your privacy rights, and that Customer will then inform Billtrust of the changes, corrections, etc. that would be made to your Personal Data (based on the request you have made to the Customer). Right to Know What Happens to Your Personal Data This is called the “right to be informed”. It means that you have the right to obtain from us all information regarding our data processing activities that concern you, such as how we collect and use your Personal Data, how long we will keep it and who it will be shared with, among other things. We are informing you of how we process your Personal Data with this Privacy Policy. We will always try to inform you about how we process your Personal Data. However, if we do not collect the Personal Data directly from you, the GDPR exempts us from the obligation to inform you (i) when providing the information is either impossible or unreasonably expensive; (ii) the gathering and/or transmission is required by law, or if (iii) the Personal Data must remain confidential, due to professional secrecy or other statutory secrecy obligations. Right to Know What Personal Data We Have About You This is called the right of access. You may ask us for a copy of the personal data we hold about you, as well as know more about how we process your personal data. Please take into account that the GDPR allows us not to satisfy your access request when: You already have the information; Providing such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, or in so far as providing such information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; and That Personal Data must remain confidential, subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by European Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy. CCPA does not allow us to disclose Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers or other government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, any health insurance or medical identification numbers, account passwords, or security questions and answers. Right to Change Your Personal Data This is called the right to rectification. It gives you the right to ask us to correct, without undue delay, anything that you think is wrong with the Personal Data we have on file about you and to complete any incomplete personal data. If your account settings do not allow you to change it, please contact us and we will do our best to change the Personal Data for you. Right to Delete Your Personal Data This is called the right to erasure, right to deletion or the “right to be forgotten”. This means that you can ask us to delete your Personal Data. Sometimes, we can delete your Personal Data. However, at other times, it is just not possible, such as when the law tells us we are not allowed to. If that is the case, we will consider if we can limit how we use your Personal Data, instead of deleting it. Occasions Where We Cannot fulfill a Deletion Request Under the GDPR or the CCPA The GDPR and the CCPA allow us to deny a request to erase your Personal Data, if we or our service providers need to retain the Personal Data to: Complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Data; fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law; Provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you; Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities; Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights or exercise another right provided for by law; Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent; Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations, based on your relationship with us; Comply with a legal obligation, including (but not limited to) obligations from the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act; or Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Right to Ask Us to Change How We Process Your Personal Data This is called the right to restrict processing. It is your right to ask us to only use or store your Personal Data for certain purposes. You have this right in certain occasions, such as where you believe the data is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful. This right enables you to ask us to suspend the usage of Personal Data about you, such as when you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it. Right to Ask Us to Stop Using Your Personal Data This is called the right to object. This is your right to tell us to stop using your Personal Data. You have this right, where we rely on a legitimate interest of ours (or of a third party). You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. We will stop processing the relevant Personal Data unless: (i) we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, or freedoms; or (ii) we need to continue processing your Personal Data to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim. If we have received your Personal Data in reliance on the Privacy Shield, you may also have the right to opt out of having your Personal Data shared with third parties and to revoke your consent to our sharing your Personal Data with third parties. You may also have the right to opt out, if your Personal Data is used for any purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or which you originally authorized. Right to Port or Move Your Personal Data This is called the right to “data portability”. It is the right to ask for and download Personal Data about you that you have given us or that you have generated by virtue of the use of our services, so that you can: Move it; Copy it; Keep it for yourself; or Transfer it to another organization.

When you request electronically to determine which data we have about you, we will provide you with a copy in electronic format. Right Related to Automated Decision Making We sometimes use computers to study your Personal Data. We might use this Personal Data, so we know how you use our services. For decisions that may seriously impact you, you have “the right not to be subject to automatic decision-making, including profiling”. However, in those cases, we will always explain to you when we might do this, why it is happening and its effect. Right to Withdraw Your Consent Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your Personal Data, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, our use of your Personal Data before you withdraw your consent is still lawful. If you have given consent for your details to be shared with a third party, and wish to withdraw this consent, please also contact the relevant third party in order to change your preferences. Right Not to be Discriminated Against for Exercising your Privacy Rights We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. Unless the applicable data protection laws permit it, we will not: Deny you goods or services. Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. Provide you with a different level or quality of goods or services. Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

Verification of Your Identity Bear in mind that to evaluate your privacy rights requests (except the requests to stop the sale of your Personal Data), we need to be sure it was you who made the request. Consequently, we might need some identification to check that you are, who you say you are. To verify your identity, we will ask you some questions concerning information we already hold about you or ask you to verify that you’re the owner of the email address or phone number you are using to contact us. For this verification, we may ask you information related to various identifiers such as, your first name, last name, email address, phone number, complete billing address, and complete mailing address. We will only use the Personal Data you provide us in a request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Please note that you may only make a consumer request to know or data portability twice within a twelve (12)-month period. Response Timing and Format of Our Responses We will confirm the receipt of your request in ten (10) days and, in that communication, we will also describe our identity verification process (if needed) and when you should expect a response, except when we have already granted or denied the request. Please allow up to thirty (30) days for us to reply to your requests (except requests to stop selling your Personal Data) from the day we received your request. If we need more time [up to ninety (90) days in total], we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the contact details associated with that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will send our written response electronically, unless you ask us to send our response by mail. We will only cover the twelve-month period preceding the moment we receive the request in any disclosures that we provide you with. We will act upon your request to opt out from selling your Personal Data in fifteen (15) days. We will also notify the third parties to whom we sold your Personal Data of your request and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Data, if they do. We will inform you about this within ninety (90) days from the receipt of your request. If we cannot satisfy a request, we will also provide the reason(s) in our response. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without difficulty. We promise that we will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. There may be exceptions when we may charge a fee, if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate, before completing your request. How Does Billtrust Protect your Information?
