					Terms of Service (“Terms,” and collectively, the “Agreement”). This Supplement is an integral part of the Heartbeat Privacy Policy linked here . It is not a standalone privacy policy. Rather, this Supplement provides 
					privacy disclosures to California residents as required by California law to

					personal information Heartbeat has collected and individual rights of California
					residents relative to that personal information. As stated in the Privacy Policy, we collect personal information from “Users,” 
					who are Heartbeat individual customers or business customer representatives
					who use the Heartbeat Services and website (“Site”). We also collect personal
					information from “Contacts,” who are individual healthcare or medical 
					professionals whose information is provided to Users based on Users’ 
					searches using the Heartbeat Prospector Service. Using the Heartbeat 
					Services via the Site, Users can lookup “Profiles” of Contacts by Users who 
					submit queries to the Heartbeat Prospector by searching for healthcare or 
					medical professionals by full name, specialization, credential, state of 
					licensure, years or experience, whether the individual is a sole proprietor, city, 
					state, zip code, gender, pharmaceuticals provides or relationships with 
					pharmaceutical companies, school attended, graduation year, or license/NPI 
					number. The Services return the available “Data” for a Contact.  In specific, 
					Profiles of healthcare and medical professionals consist of available contact 
					information (email addresses, direct telephone numbers, cell/mobile phone 
					numbers, fax numbers, and postal addresses to the extent available to 
					Heartbeat). The Data provided by Heartbeat may also include (to the extent 
					available) other information about a healthcare or medical professional, such 
					as specialties, credential obtained, years of experience, whether the 
					professional is a sole proprietor, states in which the professional is licensed, 
					gender, information about pharmaceuticals provided and supplier 
					relationships, education, year graduated, and license/NPI number. CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT DISCLOSURES i. Categories of Personal Information and Recipients The table below summarizes the categories of personal information we collect

					that we collected from you and retained by us, subject to certain conditions 
					and exceptions under the law.  For instance, we have the right to retain

							collected, provide a good or service requested by the California 
							resident, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing

					please contact us by one of the methods listed below in the Contact Us 
					section.  Please contact us using one of these methods if you wish to have an 
					authorized agent make a request for individual rights on your behalf. Verification of Requests to Exercise Individual Rights For Users:  We will verify your identity in response to a request to exercise 
					your individual rights by requiring you to log into your password-protected 
					account, going to the Section in your profile called “Exercising Individual 
					Privacy Rights,” checking the box next to the individual rights you wish to 
					exercise, and saving your preferences. For Contacts that are not Users: We will verify your identity in response to a request to exercise your 
							individual rights by requiring that you to provide two pieces of 
							information that Heartbeat already has in the Contact’s Profile from the 
							following categories:  for instance, email address or telephone number. In addition, in the case of a request for specific pieces of personal 
							information, we will ask for an additional piece of information that 
							Heartbeat already has in the Contact’s Profile in addition to the two 
							pieces described above, together with a signed declaration under 
							penalty of perjury that the requestor is the consumer whose personal 
							information is the subject of the request or a representative acting on 
							behalf of that consumer. We will not provide or delete information as requested if we are unable to 
					verify the identity of the requestor as required above or have reason to believe
					that the request is fraudulent. We may ask for additional verification if we 
					suspect fraud, such as a copy of an identification credential from the 
					requestor. We will use any such additional information strictly for identity 
					verification purposes, and it will be deleted following the completion of the 
					verification process. Policy Against Discrimination California residents have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by any
					business covered by the CCPA for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred
					by the CCPA. Accordingly, Heartbeat will not discriminate against individual 
					California residents for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA, 
					including by: Denying goods or services to the California resident Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including 
							through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties. Providing a different level or quality of goods or services Suggesting that the California resident will receive a different price or
							rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or 
							services Sale of Personal Information of Minors Heartbeat does not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16
					years of age. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS REGARDING “DO 
						NOT TRACK” SIGNALS Under California law, online service providers must disclose in their privacy 
					policies how they respond to “do not track” settings. These are settings users 
					can set in their browser software. Currently, there is no standard governing 
					what, if anything, a website operator should do when receiving a “do not track”
					signal. Accordingly, Heartbeat does not currently take action in response to a 
					“do not track” browser setting. As industry standards regarding do not track 
					settings emerge, Heartbeat will revisit and amend this policy to account for 
					these standards. CONTACT US If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this Supplement or
