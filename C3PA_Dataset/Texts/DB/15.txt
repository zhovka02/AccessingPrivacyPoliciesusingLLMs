Arity provides services directly to consumers and indirectly through companies such as mobile application providers and insurance companies to capture and understand driving behavior. Arity also provides some products, only to business customers, referred to as business clients, for their internal purposes. Arity designs its products and services with privacy and data protection in mind. Arity works with many different business clients such as mobile application providers, vehicle manufacturers, and insurance companies. When working with these business clients, Arity may collect information directly from consumers or, the business client may collect the information and share it with Arity. Personal information we collect Arity collects both personal and other information about you. Personal information (also referred to as personal data in some jurisdictions) is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked (directly or indirectly) with you. In contrast, non-personal information does not and cannot reveal an individual’s identity such as information that has been deidentified or aggregated. Please note that the type and amount of personal information collected from or about you will differ based on the products, features, and services you use, your relationship with Arity, and the country in which the products, features and services are provided. In certain circumstances, Arity may collect personal information about you in its role as a service provider on behalf of its business clients. When Arity acts as a service provider, the collection and use of personal information is subject to the privacy policies of the business clients and not this Privacy Statement. We collect the following categories of personal information: Geolocation data: Includes geolocation coordinates, including latitude, longitude, and altitude, your direction of travel, Wi-Fi access points, and the time the information was recorded. Personal identifiers: Includes name, alias, postal address, phone number, VIN, unique device or personal identifier, online identifier – such as Mobile Ad ID, internet protocol (IP) address, and email address. Personal Characteristics: Age, marital status, gender, and occupation. We collect some demographic information for research purposes including race, ethnicity, employment status, education, household income, household size, household children, and community type. Commercial and service related information: If Arity’s services are provided in connection with an insurance product (provided by an insurance company or employer), we may also receive the following information: Insurance policyholder demographic information and policy information, insurance claims data, motor vehicle records and consumer report data, including credit score. Internet or other electronic network activity information (including mobile app information): Includes browsing history, search history, information regarding your interaction with our website, mobile apps, and advertisements we facilitate, links you use, referral pages or web pages you visit while visiting our websites, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), and cookies.

Inferences: Inferences drawn from personal information collected to create a profile reflecting preferences, characteristics, predispositions, and driving habits and behavior. For example, Arity may derive miles traveled, acceleration, deceleration, braking behavior, cornering, speed, and trip routing from information coming from your mobile device, including location data. Sensitive Personal Information: Some personal information we collect is defined under the law as sensitive personal information. The sensitive personal information we collect includes precise geolocation information. When engaging in market research surveys, we may also collect race and ethnicity. Sources of personal information We collect personal information and other information about you in several ways and from several sources. Personal information and other information are collected from the following sources: Directly from consumers via a third-party mobile app, Arity’s mobile app (Routely ® ) or devices installed in vehicles. For some products, Arity embeds its technology in its business clients’ mobile app, allowing Arity to collect geolocation and related driving behavior information directly from consumers. From Arity business clients via their mobile app or other device or directly from the business client (not via the mobile app) in connection with services you’ve requested from the business client. For example, a business client may provide Arity with information not collected from an app that would help Arity better develop its models. From other parties such as our corporate affiliates, data brokers, and service providers. Directly from consumers during or in connection with an interview, survey or similar interaction. From third parties when Arity is acting as a service provider.

Non-Discrimination Rights: We don’t discriminate against you if your exercise any of the privacy rights described in this privacy statement.

Therefore, in most cases, we will be unable to verify your identity to locate your data and will be unable to return specific pieces of information to you or correct your personal information. However, you may be able to request information collected by Arity from one of our business clients who provide you with a product or service. Submitting a Request: To submit a request, visit arity.consumerprivacyinfo.com or email us at privacy@arity.com .

Sharing or Sale of Personal Information: We do not sell personal information for monetary value. For our Targeted Advertising Service, we share device identifiers (Mobile Ad IDs) with marketers, which these advertisers may use to provide you with relevant, targeted advertising and monitor advertising metrics. This sort of online advertising is called cross-context behavioral advertising under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Except for this kind of sharing, Arity does not sell or share any other personal information. CCPA provides California residents the right to opt-out of the “sharing” of your information for cross-context behavioral advertising. Regardless of where you live, you can learn how to opt out of this “sharing” for targeted advertising by visiting Your Privacy Choices . Use and Sharing of Sensitive Personal Information: Arity uses sensitive personal information (precise geolocation data) and shares insights derived from that information for targeted online advertising. You may have the right to limit this use of your sensitive personal information. To find out how to limit this use, visit Your Privacy Choices . Consumer Request Metrics: The following lists the number of access, deletion, and data sale/share opt out requests Arity received, complied with and denied from residents of California in 2022 and the average number of days it took to complete a request. To enhance user privacy, Arity does not store or associate driving behavior information with name, address, or any other combination of data that would allow us to reasonably match your identity to this data. Because of the way Arity keeps data, we cannot reasonably match a person’s identity driving behavior information, resulting in the denial of deletion and disclosure requests. Please note that these metrics do not include requests made to our Business Clients. 2022 Data Access Requests Number of requests received 9 Number of requests complied with in whole or in part 0 Number of requests denied 9 Average days to complete a request 1 2022 Data Deletion Requests Number of requests received 44 Number of requests complied with in whole or in part 0 Number of requests denied 44 Average days to complete a request 2 2022 Data Sale/Share Opt Out Requests* Number of requests received 33,207 Number of requests complied with in whole or in part 33,207 Number of requests denied 0 Average days to complete a request 7 *Number includes all “CCPA Opt Out Tool” global opt out requests received by the DAA’s AppChoices tool.

Specific information for users in the EU, UK, EEA, and Switzerland This section applies to personal information (referred to in this section as personal data) collected from users in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK) or Switzerland or otherwise subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our Legal Basis for Processing: For personal data that we process in connection with any products or services we offer to you or our business clients, we will generally process that personal data (i) based on consent, (ii) in order to take steps at your request, or (iii) for our legitimate interests in providing our services to you or otherwise in supporting the business needs. Your Access and Choices: You may have the following rights in relation to your personal data: Rectify any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you; Have your personal data erased under certain circumstances; Have the processing of your personal data restricted where you dispute its accuracy, if you think its processing is unlawful, if you otherwise object to its processing, or when we no longer need your personal data and you need it in relation to a legal claim; Have access to your personal data, and the right to receive copies of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and transfer those copies to another data controller, under certain circumstances; Complain to your national data protection regulator if you feel that any of your personal information is not being processed in accordance with the GDPR. To exercise your rights to access, rectify or erase your personal data, you can submit a request at aritygdpr.consumerprivacyinfo.com . Use of your Personal Data for Analytics and Profiling: We use your personal data to assist in our development of predictive driving models. We may profile your personal data only for the purposes of creating a driving score (“Driving Score”), which is used for our analytics purposes to develop and validate our predictive driving models.  To develop our predictive driving models we gather information about your driving behaviors, such as speed, change in speed, and other aspects of how much, where and when you drive to predict driving risk.  These driving behaviors may be combined with other demographic or geographic information about driving risk for certain locations, which incorporate relative risks. However, we take steps to remove all personal data that is not necessary to the predictive driving models. So, while your Driving Score incorporates your GPS location data, it will not be directly connected to your name, contact information, or vehicle information unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so in advance. In addition, we do not do any of the following without obtaining your prior explicit consent to do so: Use personal data or Driving Scores to make automated decisions that have significant effects for individuals, because individuals are not identifiable within the data set; Use any insights, model output, or Driving Scores with personal data for any purpose other than internal analytics or our predictive driving models; or Use your profile or Driving Score to advertise to you. After pseudonymizing the Driving Scores, we may share the pseudonymized Driving Scores with business clients. Please refer to the business client’s privacy notices for the products and services you have elected to use for details about their privacy practices.  Other than sharing pseudonymized Driving Scores with business clients, we do not share Driving Scores with third parties, unless we are required pursuant to lawful legal process. Your Driving Score will in no way impact the availability or your use of our products or services. Your Right to Withdraw Consent: If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing the relevant personal data except to the extent we have other grounds for processing under applicable laws. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. You may withdraw your consent at any time; however, Arity will not be able to provide or continue to provide products or services to you. There may be cases where restrictions on the amount of data that can be disclosed to data subjects under applicable law (for example, if that would necessarily involve disclosing data about another person).
