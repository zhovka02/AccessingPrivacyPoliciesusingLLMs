Ad Companies, on our behalf, may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising, content, and for other ad-related purposes in this browser, and in browsers and devices associated with this browser.¬† This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising. You may visit the Digital Advertising Alliance‚Äôs (‚ÄúDAA‚Äù) website at www.aboutads.info/choices to learn more about this type of advertising, as well as opt-out of this form of advertising on your browser for those companies participating in DAA‚Äôs self-regulatory program.

OUR RESONATE ELEMENTS DATA, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS & SERVICES The section below describes our privacy practices for information we collect, acquire, and use in association with our marketing and advertising business, and the related Resonate Elements TM data, technology, and methodology that power our products and services. Resonate is a research company, a marketing analytics company, and a digital advertising technology company. As a result, our activities are split into research, marketing analytics, and advertising divisions. We provide more information regarding the collection, use and disclosures related to data, and in conjunction with our privacy practices, for each of these divisions below. COLLECTION AND USE (a) Research. Resonate performs research, often in conjunction with research partners, who assist us in engaging consumers and collecting information about the attitudes and values, brand preferences, preferred product attributes, demographics, and many other characteristics describing those individuals (‚ÄúResearch Members‚Äù), as well as the websites those Research Members visit online.¬† This research includes consumer surveys, to which we may associate online and digital identifiers as well as the reported survey responses that may regard Internet activity, purchasing behavior, and interests in certain products or topics. ¬†For example, we may have an interest in understanding the views of the online population generally regarding the values that affect their purchasing of different products, or their stance on particular issues, such as climate change or healthcare reform and what a segment of this online population reads online. We may also work with partners to collect data from browsers or devices to help predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices to help us provide more relevant advertising across such devices and browsers. To assist us in this research and to better target advertisements, Resonate may receive a variety of information through partnerships with online and offline third-party data providers, such as retailers, analytics companies, consumer data providers, advertisers, through our technology on non-affiliated websites and mobile apps, and other third parties. This information we collect and receive includes online and digital identifiers such as cookies and a unique Resonate ID, commercial or transactional records or interests in certain products or services, Internet activity such as websites and mobile apps visited and used and the ads you interact with, and other information about linked to the information listed above such as interests we infer from that information. We may use this information in conjunction with the information and cookie or unique Resonate ID we associate with your browser or mobile device, to develop, support, perform, deliver, and improve our products and services, such as powering our marketing analytics and advertising discussed below. This information will also be used for other internal operations and research, legal compliance, auditing, and debugging or troubleshooting purposes. The research techniques that we or our research partners use in collecting information about Research Members are tailored based on our business needs, but in all cases where Resonate directly collects information from Research Members, we disclose what information we collect and how we may use this data. We use the research to predict characteristics of consumers in service to our marketing analytics software, and to predict the online ads that are most likely to be of interest to you and others as more fully described in the advertising section below. We do not use the information collected during the research phase to explicitly target Research Members with online advertising during the ad delivery phase described below. To the extent that an individual might be a Research Member and the recipient of an advertisement delivered by Resonate this would be coincidental. (b) Marketing Analytics. To perform marketing analytics, we use the information described in the Research section to help marketers further understand audiences of interest, so they may ultimately create more engaging content, provide more compelling offers, or highlight more relevant products. (c) Advertising. By analyzing the information described in the Research section, Resonate‚Äôs proprietary technology will predict the online ads that are most likely to be of interest to you. We deliver advertisements to: (i) the websites and mobile apps where consumers with the desired attitudes are most likely to visit or (ii) to a webpage or mobile app you are visiting or using if we believe you have the desired attitudes and attributes based on the information we have collected about you (as described below). In addition, we may ask our third party advertising partners to deliver an advertisement to you if they have associated you with a particular attribute (e.g., demographic or geographic information) or desired attitude. When we serve an advertisement, we, a service provider working on our behalf or one of our data partners, may set a cookie or collect other unique identifiers on your browser or device or request that you complete a survey. When you interact with that ad or survey, we or our partner collects the cookie or other unique identifier and/or survey responses about the attributes and/or attitudes associated with the advertisement and your interactions with it, including whether you have clicked the ad. In the event that we see your cookie somewhere on the Internet again at a later date, we use the cookie and the information associated to it to determine if we should deliver to you an advertisement that may be of interest to you. We do not collect your name or contact information in or related to our delivery of advertisements. We, and/or our data partners, also use the information associated with the cookie or collected through the survey to improve our services and to calculate and measure the effectiveness, reach and/or frequency of our advertising campaigns. Our data partners are required to use the information associated with these cookies or surveys in conformance with applicable law. We also use the information collected described in the Research section and Advertising section in order to audit our interactions with your browser or device; detect and protect against security incidents, fraud, and illegal activity, debugging and troubleshooting our services, performing our services such as accounting and analytics, internal research to improve our services, and other internal operations to maintain and improve our services. DISCLOSURE We currently disclose the information collected during the performance of our research activities described in the Research section and Advertising section in aggregated form to support our sales and marketing efforts with unaffiliated third parties. We may also disclose the ¬†information collected as described above including online or digital identifiers, commercial or transactional records, Internet activity, and other information linked to the information listed above such as your inferred interests and your interactions with ads with advertising companies, advertising networks, analytics providers, social networks, customers, and other third parties for their use in advertising, marketing, analytics, and their internal operations to maintain and improve their services. .
