This Policy applies to Blackbaud’s collection and use of personal data in connection with our marketing and provision of the Blackbaud Solutions, customer support and other services (collectively, the “Services”), for example if you are a customer, visit the website, interact with us at industry conferences, or work for a current or prospective customer of the Services. In addition, our service Target Analytics® collects data on individuals in the United States to provide non-profit customers with accurate information on their prospective constituents in the Social Good space. You can read more about our privacy practices for Target Analytics® below. The Services don’t include JustGiving, which has its own privacy policy. The terms “personal data” or “personal information” refer to information that can reasonably identify an individual. If you’re a constituent, supporter, patient, or student of one of our customers to which we provide the Services, your data will be used in accordance with that customer’s privacy policy. You can read more about this at https://kb.blackbaud.com/knowledgebase/articles/Article/200862 . In providing the Services, Blackbaud acts as a service provider and thus, this Policy will not apply to constituents of our customers. Collection and Use of Personal Information We collect personal data that you provide to us, either by creating a Blackbaud account, using the website, submitting ‘Contact Us’ forms, or otherwise interacting with us (like at conferences and trade shows). Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register for a Blackbaud ID, subscribe to e-mail newsletters, complete an online form, download resource information, or when requesting information about or purchasing our Services. We may collect data about you from third parties. As is typical for businesses that market their products to other organizations, sometimes we obtain your work contact information from third party data suppliers or joint marketing partners to contact you with communications containing promotions, customer stories, Blackbaud news and updates or thought leadership. We may also get your information from publicly-available sources and social networking sites, like LinkedIn or your organization’s website. Blackbaud collects data in the following categories: Category Examples Identifiers Name, postal address, email, IP address Commercial or transactions information Your organization’s purchase of our Services Internet/Solutions activity Your interaction with our websites or Solutions Professional information Role at your organization In addition to the purposes described when we collect data from you, we may use your personal information in the following ways: Log In: Using your Blackbaud-associated login (such as Blackbaud ID), we allow you to sign into the secure portion of our website or a Blackbaud Solution. We also use your data to give you access to the Blackbaud Community, where we may notify you of important news and alerts about our Services.  For more information about Blackbaud ID, please see https://www.blackbaud.com/company/privacy-policy/blackbaud-id . Information Requests: We send you information you request about the Blackbaud Services. Marketing Communications: We may contact you about promotions, customer stories, Blackbaud news and updates, or thought leadership content. We may send these communications via email or postal mail, call your organization, or serve you advertisements on our website and others. If you would no longer like to receive such emails, please follow the “Unsubscribe” instructions at the end of each email. Your e-mail address will be removed from our marketing list. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request, as some promotions may already be in process. To opt out of being contacted by any other communication methods, please contact us at webmaster@blackbaud.com. Customers: If you’re a Blackbaud customer, we may use your personal data to provide Services you request and in connection with payments. Improving Blackbaud: We use aggregated and personal data about you and/or your constituents’ use of our websites and the Blackbaud Services to develop, improve, and test those services. Compliance and Safety: We may use your personal data to comply with our legal obligations and to identify and remediate suspected or actual fraudulent activity or security incidents. We keep your personal information in an identifiable form for as long as we have a legitimate reason to use the data and as required by law. Blackbaud may share your personal information as necessary to provide the Services or as you specifically request. We may disclose your data to our affiliated organizations and subsidiaries, and to service providers who render services to us or you on our behalf. We also may disclose your information if required by law or to enforce our legal rights or defend us against a legal claim or for the identification or remediation of suspected or actual fraudulent activity or security incidents. We may share your information in connection with a sale or reorganization of Blackbaud. We may also share your personal data if it is necessary to act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety of Blackbaud customers, website visitors, or the public.

Use of Cookies A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them. We may use cookies for a number of purposes—for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our website for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers or to store a user name or encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our website. To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Blackbaud collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer’s machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the website previously. Our cookies will track only your activity relating to your online activity on this website, and will not track your other Internet activity. You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our Services or website features.

An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our website, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand from what regions of the world our website visitors come.

The Global Privacy Control is a signal that can be enabled in certain browsers or browser extensions. Contests, Sweepstakes and Other Promotions On our website, you may wish to participate in contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that we may offer from time to time. Through these promotions, you may choose to participate in activities such as sharing information found on our websites with others and sending email invitations. If you choose to participate in these promotions, and are eligible to do so, we may ask you for information such as your name, email address, date of birth and telephone number. In connection with any contests, sweepstakes and other promotions that we may offer from time to time via the website, we use the information you provide to administer the contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. We also may use the information to communicate with you, or the other people you select, about our products and services or our partners may use such information to communicate with you about the contests, sweepstakes or other promotions or their products and services.
