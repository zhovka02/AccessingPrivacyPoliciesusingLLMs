Our solutions, which are more fully described on this website ( “Website” or “Websites” ), are used for online and offline marketing purposes. When we say “ you ” we are referring to consumers, including the person reading this Privacy Policy. We take consumer privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (“ Privacy Policy” ) describes how we use and manage information used in and licensed through Services, and how consumers can control how information about them is used and shared. We also describe in Section 6 the information we collect through our corporate website (the website this Privacy Policy is on), which is directed to Clients, prospective Clients and others When we handle information on behalf of Clients related to their own actual or prospective customers (such as to provide analysis of this information to customers), we act only as a service provider. We address these practices separately in Section 7 of this Privacy Policy. 1. Information That We Collect and the Ways We Use It In order to provide our Services, we obtain information about you through a variety of means and sources. We may combine any of the information that we collect, in order to perform our Services. We describe below the categories of information that we collect in terms required under the California Consumer Privacy Act, in order to avoid potentially confusing duplication of terms. Categories of Information we collect (and/or receive): a. Personal and online identifiers. E.g., Email addresses (generally in “hashed” or obfuscated form), telephone numbers, name, postal address, social media identifiers or handles. b. Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law. E .g., sex/gender, race, ethnicity, age or religion (which may be inferred). c. Internet Usage Data. E.g., browsing history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with our own website. d. Professional, alumni or employment-related information . E.g., job title, employer information, schools graduated from. e, Inferenced Data. E.g. Inferences about a consumer’s lifestyle, demographic or other “Interest”-based traits, that we license from other data compilers (in addition to inferences we create and/or describe above). The categories of our sources in collecting or obtaining this information are data compilers and resellers, publicly sourced as well as publicly available information (such as the US Census Bureau and US Postal Service), website and mobile application operators. 2. Our Business Purposes for Collecting and Using Personal Information The following chart provides additional information about our purposes for collecting and using your information – in effect, key aspects of our Services: Purposes of Use Data marketing services, for example: ● Providing marketing information to our Clients (which include companies, non-profit and other organizations), generally regarding their marketing, fundraising, customer service and engagement, and outreach activities. ● Helping our Clients identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs. ● Assisting our Clients with using our Services to provide their customers and prospective customers with better service, improved offerings, and special promotions, for instance, advising on which consumers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers. Online targeting, for example: ● Creating defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students). When we do this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 5. Additional marketing and database services, for example: ● Assisting in targeting and optimization of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing. ● Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases. ● Analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud. ● Providing “verification” or data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information. ● Associating or “graphing” the consumers (and prospective consumers) of our Clients across various websites or platforms, including based on their social media identifiers, e.g., to help Clients analyze or advertise to their Clients based on and across their social media presence. Operate our Services, for example: ● Improving, testing, updating and verifying our own database. ● Developing new products, operating, analyzing, improving, and securing our Services. Other internal purposes, for example: For internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance. We use the information collected from our own website, from social networks, from other “business to business” interaction (such as at trade shows) or from data compilers for the above, as well as for our own marketing and other internal business purposes. 3. How We Share Information with Third Parties and How to “Opt Out” of our Marketing Databases We typically share personal information with third parties, including our Clients and their own service providers, in the course of providing our services as described in Section 2. We also may share any of the personal information we collect as follows: Sharing for Legal Purposes: We also may share personal information with third parties in order to: (a) comply with legal process (civil or criminal) or a government investigation (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or our contracts (or our rights under the law); (c) and/or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of us, our platform, our clients, or any other person.

This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our Website. We use these technologies on our Website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services. We may work with third parties to provide or enhance our Services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form. These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies. Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device. Through such technologies, we gather information about you, such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, mobile device identification number, the sites visited before and after our Site, and about your interactions with our services, such as the time and date when you viewed a page, which advertisements you have clicked on, and whether you filled out an online form.

This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. • Functionality cookies . These are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). • Targeting or Advertisement cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose or allow the third party to collect this information as disclosed below. Not all our cookies collect personal identifiable information: We use information gathered through cookies to improve the way our Sites work, for example by employing third-party analytics tools which aggregate anonymous user information to help us better design our sites and enhance the functionality of our services for example, by remembering preferences or other choices that you make – such as user names, language preferences, and the like – we can better understand how you use our site(s) over time. In short, these tools allow us to provide you with a better, more relevant online experience. We may also work with third-party advertising companies to suggest advertisements from the services or on third-party sites based on your preferences. You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and are not “strictly necessary” for the operation of the website, and process personally identifiable information and the purposes for which we use them in the table below.

You may opt out of receiving those “b2b” marketing emails by clicking on that link. 6.

Information We Receive From Clients as a Service Provider to Them StatSocial, as a service provider, provides its Clients with services, such as customer insights and analytics (generally, providing our customers information about their own consumers or prospective consumers). When our Clients provide us with information relating to their own customers or prospective customers, we function as a service provider to those Clients. Our Clients determine how to engage with their customers and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling their own customer and transactional information. Under these circumstances, consumers are ultimately subject to the privacy policies of the Clients controlling their data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Clients. 8. Links This website may provide links to other websites that StatSocial thinks users will find interesting or useful. StatSocial is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites or companies. 9. Security and Data Integrity StatSocial takes steps to help ensure that the data we possess is housed and transmitted securely. This may include physical and electronic security precautions, firewall protections, encryption, hashing or truncation of data, and access controls to personal information. Although neither we nor any platform can guarantee 100 percent safety from hacks or illegal intrusion, we employ efforts that are designed to keep this from occurring. 10. Changes to this Privacy Policy From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes to it will become effective when it is posted to our website (or at a later date we designate). Please continue to check back to learn of any changes to this Privacy Policy 11. Your Rights and Marketing Choices (and Notice of Your Right to Opt Out) a. Privacy Rights for California Residents If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with certain additional information regarding certain rights you have regarding your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)). Please do not rely on the below information and disclosures in this Section 11 or others directed to California residents if you are not a resident of California. In particular (if you are a California resident) the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information. The CCPA allows you to request us to: ● Opt-Out of any sale by us of your personal information. ● Delete certain personal information we have collected directly from you (if any). (Most of the personal information we have is not collected by us from consumers, but rather, is obtained in other ways.) ● Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information. ● Provide you with access to and/or a copy of certain specific personal information we hold about you. The CCPA also gives you the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights. (Certain information may be exempt from these requests, under California law.) b. Your CCPA “Opt-Out” Choices You may opt out of our marketing databases (sometimes called a “do not sell” request), as outlined on the following page: Do Not Sell My Info . You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at optout@statsocial.com , in which case we will provide you with a mail-in (or email-in) form to fill out. Generally, the information that we may “Sell” for purposes of the CCPA is in the form of hashed email identifiers, other personal information (such as name/address), and inference data about interests or demographics tied to those identifiers and information. In addition, as noted in Section 2, we sometimes work with other partners and marketing channels who engage in targeted display media. You can opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising) that these partners generate by visiting the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages. Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike StatSocial’s direct opt-out). Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again. Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you. c. Right to request deletion of your personal information California residents may also request that we “delete” any personal information that we collected from you, such as if you have been a customer of ours. Note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described above. If your intent is for us to cease selling your personal information, we recommend that you request an “opt out” as described above, so that we may maintain your data on a suppression list: if we simply “delete” rather than “opting out” your information, we may receive your information in the future and cannot suppress it. You may request “deletion” by visiting our “Access and Deletion” web page here or by emailing us at optout@statsocial.com . (We may confirm with you that what you are seeking is in fact merely temporary “deletion” and not a more permanent “suppression,” i.e., “opt out” option.). We may request certain information about you in order to verify that you are the person to whom the personal data files we hold pertains. Please also note that in the event of a “deletion” request, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as debugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations. Additionally, we may need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. d. Your Right to Request Access to Your Information California residents also have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. As a California resident, you may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information. We also will take (and are required to take) certain steps to verify your identity before responding to a request, which may include, at a minimum, verifying your email address, or other information we hold about you.  You may request your information by visiting our “Access and Deletion” web page here or by emailing us at optout@statsocial.com . e. Authorized Agents You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf. However, we may require any such agent to demonstrate that it is acting on your behalf and/or has a power of attorney to do so. We may also follow up with you to verify your identity before processing the authorized agent’s request. 12. Your Rights Under the GDPR The General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) provides residents of EU nations and the United Kingdom with certain rights, and places certain obligations on us, regarding how your “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) is used. We describe those rights and obligations below. a. Legal Basis The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we’re relying on to process any “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) about you. The legal grounds for us processing your personal data for the purposes set out in Sections 2 and 6 above will typically be because: You provided your consent; it is necessary for our contractual relationship, e.g., in order to provide you services or features you’ve requested or agreed to; the processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and/or the processing is in our legitimate interest (for example, to protect the security and integrity of our systems or to provide you with customer service). b. The right to notice You have the right to notice – i.e., to be informed — about how we protect your data and respect your privacy. We provide that notice by posting this Privacy Policy or through other means at the time of or after personal information is collected. c. Your rights to delete or withdraw consent (also called a “right to be forgotten”) You may request that we “opt you out” of our active data services databases by going to this page: https://www.statsocial.com/optout/ . When you use our “opt out” feature, we will retain your information in order to maintain it on a “suppression” list to avoid your personal information being re-collected in the future (if you do not want us to do this, then please email us at privacy@statsocial.com. We may also retain information after deletion or opt-out for important legal, auditing, accounting or security purposes. (If you are seeking deletion of information we may hold for you as our corporate customer, or potential customer, please see section 12.e, below.) d. Right to Access or Rectify/Correct Your Personal Information You may also request access to a copy of your personal data by emailing us at privacy@statsocial.com. We may request certain information about you (as the law requires us to do) in order to verify that you are the person to which the datafile we hold pertains. You may also email us at info@statsocial.com if you would like to “rectify” or correct incorrect information we hold about you in our database. e. Our Corporate Customers If you have a corporate account with us, you can exercise other rights, such as your account deletion or “access” rights, by contacting us at privacy@statsocial.com. Please note that when we delete your information, we may retain it for certain important internal purposes such as legal, accounting, security or auditing purposes. f. Your GDPR “Opt Out Choices” You may object to profiling by online advertising platforms (who are generally separate third party “controllers” of Your data). You may visit industry websites provided at https://optout.aboutads.info (by the Digital Advertising Alliance and https://optout.networkadvertising.org/ (by the Network Advertising Alliance or https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ (the European Digital Advertising Alliance to do so. g. Right to Unsubscribe You may also unsubscribe from marketing and other communications that we may send (on behalf of ourselves or others) by emailing us at privacy@statsocial.com or by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in any email that we send to you. If You have a complaint about how we handle your Personal Data, please get in touch with us as at the contact addresses listed below, and we will seek to address any concerns you may have. If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority. 13. StatSocial as a Data Controller and a Data Processor EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organisations that process personal data on behalf of other organisations (known as “data processors”). If you have a question or complaint about how your personal data is handled, those should always be directed to the relevant data controller as they are the ones with primary responsibility (legally and organizationally) for your personal data. In this regard, StatSocial may act as either a data controller or a data processor with respect to your personal data, depending on the specific circumstances. For instance, when we offer our own products and services, we generally act as a “controller” as to the personal data used in those products and services. On the other hand, if we hold or process our customers’ information (such as a customer CRM file), we would generally act as a “processor” as to that information 14. Storage of Information in the United States If you are accessing our Website from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States and the Information you provide will likely be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. (We likewise generally store the Information used in our Services in the United States.) Thus, you should be aware that in accessing this website or otherwise communicating with us, the information we collect or receive from you may be subject to laws with lesser or different privacy standards than those in your own country (such as if you are in a country located in the European Union). 15.
